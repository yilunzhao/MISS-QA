            "With the emergence of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) (Wu et al. 2024; Liu et al. 2024), LLMs offer a promising solution to address the aforementioned challenges. By representing architectures in programming languages, the task of learning design principles can be framed as a language-inductive learning problem, a domain where LLMs have demonstrated proficiency (Imani, Du, and Shrivastava 2023). Therefore, leveraging LLMs as reasoning agents for automatic design principle learning is a logical step. Given their pre-training on vast knowledge, in-context learning can be employed to tackle this task, thereby mitigating the constraints posed by the number of architecture samples. Furthermore, owing to their contextual awareness, LLMs can automatically translate design principles into actionable architectural knowledge for NAS methods."

In contrast, pre-trained LLMs can ingest architecture implementations as code, perform language-based inductive reasoning to learn general design principles with few examples, and directly translate those principles into actionable constraints—thereby boosting automation, reducing sample requirements, and improving efficiency.",

            "Ground-aware Assumption. For each pixel at coordinates uᵢⱼ in the virtual view, its 3D coordinates in the virtual camera frame Xᵢⱼ are calculated based on the pixel’s position in the image and the depth assumptions. We first project all pixels to the ground plane to compute the initial assumption of 3D coordinates in virtual camera frame as … Then we compare the distance dᵢⱼ with threshold D_thres; if dᵢⱼ ≤ D_thres, the points connected to corresponding pixels in the images are assumed on the ground. If dᵢⱼ > D_thres, we assume that the points lie on a cylindrical-like surface at a fixed distance R from the camera’s optical center.",
            "To evaluate the accuracy of the Virtual Camera Projection method in the context of a 3D object detection task, we propose a weighted projection error metric based on angular discrepancies between the virtual and original camera views. … The weighted error for each corner point is then calculated as Êₚ = dₚ · (|Δθₚ| + |Δφₚ|).",
            "Given a set of multi-camera systems, we aim to design a unified virtual camera configuration that minimizes the reprojection error across all original camera configurations. To achieve this, we adopt the heuristic optimization based on the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) … The objective is to minimize the total projection error E(Θ) by iteratively sampling and updating the virtual camera parameters."
        ],
        "final_answer": "The ground-aware depth assumption provides an initial per-pixel 3D hypothesis—pixels closer than a threshold are placed on the ground plane, while farther pixels are lifted onto a cylindrical surface—thus yielding a first set of virtual camera projections. The minimizing-projection-error strategy then measures the angular and distance discrepancies between these ground-informed projections and the true virtual view via a weighted error metric. Finally, it uses an optimizer (CMA-ES) to adjust virtual camera parameters so as to minimize that projection error. In combination, the ground-aware assumption shapes the projection candidates and the error-minimization loop refines the virtual camera configuration, resulting in more accurate and robust virtual view transformations.",

            "The textual AFR and point cloud AFR are identical, with each consisting of a stack of six Self-Attention Encoders (Vaswani et al. 2017). These AFR modules fine-tune the features of their respective modalities and map them into a common feature space, enabling the subsequent computation of Riemann Attention. Internally, each AFR layer consists of multi-head self-attention (MSA) sub-layers and feed-forward neural network (FFN) sub-layers. Each of these sub-components (MSA and FFN) is encapsulated within residual connections and layer normalization operations.",
            "The AFR receives text or point cloud inputs, using a scaled dot-product attention mechanism to describe both visual and textual features. The output of the self-attention operator is defined as: ...",
            "We utilize a compact feed-forward network (FFN) to extract features, which are already integrated into more extensive representations. The FFN is composed of two nonlinear layers: where a and b are hyperparameters, v represents the input vector, W₁ and W₂ are learnable weight matrices, and b₁ and b₂ are bias terms.",
            "A complete encoding layer (Enc) can be described as follows: where Add & Norm includes a residual connection and layer normalization. The multi-layer encoder (AFR) is constructed by stacking these encoding layers sequentially, with the input of each layer being derived from the output of the preceding layer. In the AFR, stacking multiple encoder layers enables the automatic adjustment of weights between features, ensuring that crucial ones receive greater attention."

By first using scaled dot‐product self‐attention to capture contextual relationships and then refining these attended features through the feed‐forward network, AFR adaptively weights and enhances the initial text or point‐cloud representations. This produces optimized features in a common space that are well‐suited for subsequent Riemannian geometry projections.",

In this generatein of such representative samples promotes specific optimization methods, the representative samples in terms of frequency would not necessarily be at the top of the ranking list but rather the ones with varying most effective methods according to performance metrics.

            "An intuitive approach would be simply aggregating  and  without any transformation. However, as shown in Fig. 3, this approach may transfer noise or irrelevant information, highlighting the need to extract features that emphasize object-level context.",
            "From this realization, we leverage the low-rank components of VFM, which contain distinct object patterns within the graph structure. Specifically, we (I) extract the critical object-level contextual structure of  via low-rank approximation and enhance the graph structure by dynamically scaling eigenvalues.",
            "In the decomposed eigenbasis, we identify key object-level features of each graph by searching an optimal number of eigenvalues  through an energy-based approach. This ensures that the chosen  eigenvalues capture a significant portion of the graph’s energy, retaining essential structural information while discarding noise and less relevant details.",
            "We refine the low-rank components with a scaling function , which dynamically amplifies larger eigenvalues and reduces smaller ones. Compared to the conventional shrinkage function, which only focuses on noise cutoff, our approach emphasizes essential structural information, particularly object-level context features, while suppressing noise and irrelevant details."

        "final_answer": "Because simply merging the raw VFM and CLIP attention graphs would mix in noise and irrelevant connections, the model first uses a low-rank approximation to keep only the most energy-rich, object-defining spectral components, and then applies dynamic eigenscaling to amplify those key components (and de-emphasize smaller, less meaningful ones).

            "Our model also leverages CLIP’s highly effective zero-shot object classification capability (i.e., object presence prior), widely validated in prior work [34, 19, 29], to capture detailed object-level context within scenes. As such, we adjust the text embeddings based on the object presence prior encoded by CLIP. This process involves refining the embeddings to better align with object-specific semantics.",
            "The spectral object-level context distillation in Sec. 3.2 enables precise object mask generation. However, due to the nature of OVSS, where users can provide arbitrary query prompts, different parts of the same object may still be assigned to closely related categories. Meanwhile, numerous studies [34, 19, 29] have demonstrated that CLIP excels in zero-shot object classification capability. Accordingly, we utilize the zero-shot object classification score encoded by CLIP (i.e., the object presence prior) to refine text embeddings and patch-text similarity, enhancing object-centered perspective."

        "final_answer": "Because arbitrary text prompts can cause parts of the same object to be misclassified into related categories, the model uses CLIP’s zero-shot object presence prior to refine the original text embeddings.

            "Having white-box access to the decoder gives the attacker enough information to simulate the network by devising a targeted adversarial attack and using the gradients of the decoder to create the desired perturbation δ, where mo is the original watermark, mt is the target watermark and ε is the perturbation limit. We minimize the loss (L), of D(·+δ) with respect to the target watermark while maximizing the loss of D(·+δ) with respect to the original watermark, i.e. we solve the optimization problem as shown in Eq. (4).",
            "The adversarial perturbation crafting algorithm is shown in Algo 1. Inputs to the algorithm are: a watermarked image x, the target decoder D, the target watermark mt, a perturbation δ (initialized as zero), and a limiting range ε. x+δ is passed into the decoder, which decodes the secret as s. The loss between s and mt is computed using the chosen loss function L. In each iteration of the loop, the optimizer tries to minimize the loss between s and mt and maximize the loss between s and mo. Accordingly, δ is updated. This process is repeated until the model converges and the desired δ is obtained, which is the realization of the DLOVE attack on D to overwrite mo with mt."
        ],
        "final_answer": "EVE formulates a constrained optimization over the added perturbation δ so that when the perturbed watermarked image (x + δ) passes through the decoder D, the extracted watermark is driven toward the attacker's target mt rather than the original mo. In the white-box variant, EVE uses the decoder’s gradients directly to minimize the decoder’s loss on the target watermark while maximizing the loss on the original watermark (Eq. 4), subject to a perturbation magnitude bound ε. In practice (Algo 1), EVE iteratively updates δ by computing the loss L between the decoder’s output and mt (minimizing) and between the output and mo (maximizing) until convergence, yielding imperceptible but effective perturbations that overwrite the embedded watermark with the target watermark.",

The red box covers the adaptive phase dynamics formula, and the blue box covers the references and policies interacting with the task phase and state variables. The text does not specify what these elements within the red and blue boxes are called or what they do. Therefore, based on the current context, a breakthrough is not possible. Additionally, there is no diagrammatic indication or examples present in the image that would explain what [mask1] and [mask2] refer to in the text. The question requires information that is not clearly provided or observable within the image, thus rendering the answer unanswerable at this time. To answer the question, more specific information would be needed, such as a part of the text that refers to [mask1] and [mask2], or a more detailed description or diagram that narrows down the properties of these elements involved in the study. As provided, the question is beyond the scope of the present data, context, and information contained in this image. The girl's attire, accessories, and the additional student activity are not relevant to solving this question. Thus, no further steps involving chain-of-thought reasoning can be employed to answer the question due to the lack of necessary information to make a justified assertion. The complete evocation of reasoning,ivyo, indicates the primary unavailability or inaccessibility of the needed information to address the inquiry they present, leading to the judgment that the question cannot be answered with the context given.

The red box highlights the Process Monitor & Logging component, which is responsible for measuring and logging various metrics such as MAE, memory footprint, latency, instance type, GPU, memory, and hourly cost, but the specific function of <mask1> is not detailed in the image or the accompanying text. Therefore, without additional information, it is not possible to determine the function of <mask1> in this context. \n\nBased on the given instructions, the answer to the question is that the function of <mask1> is not explicitly defined or visible in the provided materials. The_CREATED prompt søkerer function may be a typographical error or an incorrect placeholder that does not correspond to any visible part of the diagram or its annotations. Consequently, there is no logical connection that can be made between <mask1> and the highlighted Process Monitor & Logging component based solely on the given context and image. \n\nThus, the answer to the question asking about the function of <mask1> is \"unanswerable\" due to the absence of clear information in the image and the provided context. It is important to note that while the CONTEXT offers a comprehensive overview of the capabilities of the CEBenchógicosulator, which includes monitoring and logging various metrics, it does not provide insight into the function of <mask1> as such. \n\nIn conclusion, the image and the accompanying text do not provide sufficient information to answer the question regarding the function of <mask1>. Therefore, the appropriate response is that the question is unanswerable based on the current information provided. \n\nIf additional information or decorator explanation is desired for the specific function of <mask1>, it would be necessary to examine material regarding the implementation of <mask1> within the CEBench Query Engine module for a complete understanding.

            "Based on the AAP phenomenon, we further introduce DIFFender, a novel DIFfusion-based DeFender framework against adversarial patch attacks, utilizing the text-guided diffusion models. DIFFender operates by first localizing the adversarial patch through the analysis of discrepancies among various denoised images and then restoring the affected region while maintaining the integrity of the original content. These two stages are guided by a unified diffusion model, which allows for a synergistic interaction that enhances overall defense performance—precise localization aids in effective restoration, and successful restoration, in turn, validates and refines the localization process.",

The two stages described above—patch localization and patch restoration—are seamlessly integrated into a unified diffusion model (e.g., Stable Diffusion), guided by the critical AAP phenomenon.

        "response": "<Answer: [mask1]> refers to the forgery segmentation highlighted by a red box in the image.</Answer> \n\nTo integrate [łącz2] outputs into fact retrieval, I would consider the outputs from machine learning models that identify different forgery types. In the sense of the highlighted mempertosing Box in the image, this could mean taking the output from the machine learning model that identifies these forgery types and using that information to narrow down the possible original images during the fact retrieval phase.\n\nThis is because knowing what type of forgery was applied to an image can help better inform the fact retrieval process. For example, if the forgery type is known to typically involve objects being removed, and this is identified in the segmentation output, then during fact retrieval, the system could prioritize images that haven't been altered by similar object removal techniques. This targeted approach could improve the accuracy and efficiency of the fact retrieval process. If the text were provided in a different format or from a different figure, this reasoning process would remain the same, as it's based on understanding where in the image the specific forgery segmentation occurs and how it relates to the overall fact retrieval strategy. If the text were missing or unclear, I would be unable to answer a question that depends on this information, as the context provided is essential for the answer.\n\nExamples of different formats or unclear text would include: if the mask or identified forgery type was not mentioned, if the fact retrieval results were not displayed alongside, or if there was no clear indication of where forgery segmentation occurs. Without visual context or clear information from text describing the forgery types or outputs, this type of answer relies on the assumption that such information is available as described. If any part of the context were missing or derivados, the conclusion about the integration of [леді] outputs into fact retrieval would be incomplete or inaccurate.

Meanwhile, the coarse texture generation in first stage also encounters the inconsistency issue across all viewpoints.",

            "For the SSL component, we follow the good practice in TTA (Chen et al., 2022a ###reference_b6###) to adopt contrastive learning. Effective classification requires that embeddings of the same class align relatively closely, while those from different classes remain distinct to ensure inter-class distinguishability. To achieve this, we introduce Contrastive Prompt Tuning (CPT).",
            "Initially, we integrate CPT with supervised learning (stage 1) and subsequently rely exclusively on CPT for new class adaptation (stage 2).",
            "Our empirical analysis reveals that CPT and classification tasks exhibit a consistently positive gradient correlation across 11 datasets. This correlation suggests that both tasks drive the model’s optimization in similar directions, allowing CPT to effectively act as a proxy for supervised learning during the adaptation phase."

            "Section 3.4: “Global–local Semantic Encoding: Although the improved relation graph and initialization function incorporate high-level semantic associations among entities, the original semantic features remain isolated from the CMP calculations. To address this, the SCMP module employs two CMP channels to encode global and local representations. The local representations are derived from the existing query-specific CMP process, while the global representations are encoded independently of the query, using all-ones vectors for relation-level initialization and semantic features for entity-level initialization. The complete two-channel calculations of SCMP are defined as follows: … The trainable parameters Θ and Φ are shared in two channels. Notably, the global representations can be precomputed and integrated into each query-specific CMP process, permitting SCMP to keep time and space complexities akin to basic CMP-based models.”"

            "To effectively leverage semantic features in the CMP process while avoiding these challenges, we propose a novel message passing framework called Semantic Conditional Message Passing (SCMP), including two core techniques: Semantic-injected Entity Initialization and Global-local Semantic Encoding.",
            "Instead of using the original semantic features, we inject the semantic neighbor labels into the entity initialization. The improved initialization function is defined as follows: h^{0}_{i|q} = I(i=q)·e_q + I(i∈N^{sem}_{x,q})·v_{sem}, where v_{sem} is a trainable vector shared across all semantic neighbors and N^{sem}_{x,q} comes from the unified feature matrix.",

The outputs of these two channels are then merged by a small MLP to produce the final conditional triple representations."
        ],
        "final_answer": "SCMP extends the standard CMP framework by (1) altering the node initialization step so that entities identified as semantic neighbors (via a precomputed, SVD-based unified feature space) receive a shared trainable ‘semantic neighbor’ embedding instead of zeros, and (2) running CMP in two parallel channels—a query-conditional (local) channel and a query-agnostic (global) channel seeded by the unified semantic features—and then merging their outputs via an MLP. Together, these augmentations allow SCMP to inject high-order semantic information into every layer of conditional message passing while preserving CMP’s theoretical expressiveness.",

            "Next, we apply our custom token-based encoding technique. The goal here is to represent the content of each cell with the minimum number of tokens while ensuring that each cell has a unique representation.",
            "Prior to encoding, we first sort the cells in ascending order based on the number of tokens they contain. This strategy allows us to resolve potential collisions more easily, as cells with fewer tokens are processed first. A collision occurs when two distinct cell contents map to overlapping token sequences.",
            "Our encoding process incorporates several high-level heuristics to enhance efficiency and accuracy:\n a. Single Token Preservation: If a cell’s content consists of a single token, it remains unchanged.\n b. Multi-Token Optimization: For cells with multiple tokens, we aim to represent the content using only two tokens whenever possible.\n c. Bracket Handling: We handle incomplete bracket sequences by checking if a token starts with an opening bracket (e.g., [, {) and lacks a matching closing bracket. In such cases, we concatenate subsequent tokens until the bracket is closed.",
            "The overall objective is to use the fewest tokens possible while maintaining uniqueness across all cell contents. By treating each tokenized cell as a unit, we can reduce the total number of tokens significantly without losing semantic integrity."
        ],
        "final_answer": "Token-based Encoding reduces token count by first sorting cells by their initial token length to avoid collisions, then applying heuristics that preserve single-token cells unchanged, represent multi-token cells in only two tokens where possible, and handle bracketed sequences in a way that prevents syntax errors. This approach ensures each cell is encoded into a minimal yet unique token sequence, thereby reducing overall tokens while retaining semantic distinctions between cells.",

This equality puts a constraint on the neural network that estimates f, namely f(g·x)=g·f(x), i.e. f must be equivariant with respect to group actions by elements from G. Since G is a subgroup of O(3) we also say that f must be subequivariant with respect to G.”",

While we process scalar features with multilayer perceptrons and standard 1-D convolutions, we process vector features with specific linear and convolution layers, and combine scalar and vector features with specialized non-linear layers.”"

(2021) applies per‐point nonlinearity for vector features only. Since we already apply convolutions over time we simply apply a non‐linearity pointwise. Unlike Deng et al. (2021), we need to mix scalar and vector features and thus adapt the gated nonlinearity (Weiler et al., 2018) to pointwise nonlinearity.",

We run a single MLP with an output of size 2C, and split it into new norm features r and new activations a which we modulate with a non‐linearity σ. Finally, we rescale the original vector features according to the new norm: v' = v ⊙ (r · σ(a)), where ⊙ denotes element‐wise multiplication and the concatenation was along the feature dimension."

This concatenated vector is fed through a shared MLP whose 2C outputs are split into two C-dimensional vectors: one r of \"new norms\" and one a of gating activations. A pointwise non-linearity σ is applied to a, and then each original vector feature v is rescaled by the element-wise product r·σ(a). Because r and σ(a) are computed from invariant quantities (scalars and norms), and scaling commutes with rotations, the resulting transformation of the vector features remains equivariant.",

            "Incremental pose optimization. We employ an incremental pose optimization approach, introducing a new image into the training loop at fixed intervals. Given the input images and corresponding masks of the calibration object, the first image is designated as the reference image. Multiple projection views around the object are sampled to acquire mask images, and the view with the best matching mask is selected as the initial pose for the first frame. For each newly added frame, we first compute 2D correspondences with the previous image using SuperPoint and SuperGlue. The matching pixels in the image cast rays to locate corresponding 3D points on the object, leveraging the optimized pose for precise surface positioning. This forms 2D-3D correspondences between the newly added image and the object, allowing the PnP with RANSAC to calculate the initial pose of the new image.",

This is actually not a question, as the diagram has been stripped of all labels and any text in the image.  The purpose of using a diagram is to help explain the process and operation, which is absent in this case. Instead, this is simply a figure with several boxes and arrows not accompanied by any written explanation. When trying to figure out the overall structure being designed, it is most effective to use diagram or graphic aesthetics to suggest structure. In presenting your answer, it is best to always refer back to the diagram, use a logical flowchart structure to explain each step in the process, and support the diagram with certain notes describing its contents. \nFor replacing the diagram with words, generally there is a need to re-establish the diagram and all its options. The fundamental framework of the diagram is as follows: \n1. Image encoder\n2. Outline-based spatial attention aggregation\n3. Frame feature\n4. Binary classifier\n\nThe parts of the diagram are filled in by one or more method, giving the following description. \n\nThese methods complete the outline-based spatial attention aggregation by modeling the outstanding of stacked rolling on a fixed time interval [0,T] to model the feature sampling yavuzeko. Stacking consists of moving a fixed interval length [0,T] on the previous frame feature to obtain the frame feature, which is the process by which the presented image encoder and the binary classifier in turn. For that matter, theotov process is described in detail to be able to be completed.\n\n\nCaption: Figure 2.

This diagram can be comprehended by breaking it into three parts: output, question, and explanation. Thus, it is able to complete the detailed explanation of the current content, and complete the spatial extraction and features to conduct the final output process. Thus, the process of summary physical machines and other operations can then achieve the degree of this description process.  Thus, it is only byामुळे a detailed description with all of its parts, finally, be able to present the entire process that will support us in the answer. Thus.

            "Inspired by the pioneer work VadCLIP (Wu et al., 2024b), we also introduce a dual-branch framework, namely, classification branch and alignment branch. Specifically, given a video V, we employ a frozen image encoder of CLIP to extract the frame-level feature f, where T is the length of video V, and d is the feature dimension. Then these features are fed into two branches after a series of information enhancements, classification branch is to directly predict the anomaly confidence p_b by a binary classifier, another align branch is to compute the anomaly category probability p_a by means of the image-to-concept alignment. With p_b and p_a in hands, we adopt the typical TopK and the recent MIL-Align strategies to compute the video-level anomaly prediction and category prediction, respectively, these predictions are subsequently used to calculate losses and provide data support for model optimization."

Consider the performance evaluation: The red box's content is evaluated, and the system's impact and Kalou region's localization are measured.\n4. Answer the question: Since the red box content is about abnormal event localizations, we're looking for something that relates specifically to that. The options don't seem to have any direct relation to the two of the candidate options, though.\n5. Consider all the options: The left option is not related anyway. The right option talks about defect inspection without mentioning procedures or evaluations. Since the other two options have no relevance at all to the key events and aspects described in the diagram content, the only reasonable conclusion is the entity starting with '-ти شہر' is unrelated to the given information.\nAnswer: unanswerable. There's a [ti soulmate] underlining key concepts that don't match the provided context either.

The image contains a complex diagram with colored brackets and annotations around different components of the diagram, which makes it difficult to identify a specific area within the image based on the provided context. The masked phrases reference the content highlighted by different colored boxes which are not okuwmifiable from the provided information as it does not give a clear point of reference where these boxes are located within the diagram. Without such clarity, the direct answer to the question cannot be provided. It's also worth noting that the question itself asks for these two specific references, which adds another layer of complexity to answering it without a clearer context. So, the overall answer is **unanswerable** due to the lack of clarity in the diagram's structure and the annotations provided. The question seems to ask for the contents highlighted by colors red and blue, which cannot be determined from the current context. Therefore, a complete and accurate answer is not possible. The original diagram, especially the annotations, would be required to make this question answerable. Therefore, I conclude with a response **NO SUCH THING** in this context. The question requires a visual element (diagram) that is not provided or represented in text alone. Unfortunately, without the-chain-of-thought approach, we cannot navigate through this challenge. The question is clearly posed; however, without seeing the image, we are at a standstill, and therefore the answer holds no value.

Next, our MTB generates different scale Qi (= Q1, Q2, Q3), Ki (= K1, K2, K3) and Vi (= V1, V2, V3) projections through adopting 1×1 point-wise convolution (PWConv) followed 3×3 depth-wise convolution (DWConv).

A reversed‐attention mechanism uses this concatenation to refine and produce the decoded feature maps (D_i).

        "response": "The [mask1] refers to the process in Fig. 2 that utilizes a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to compare a CXR image to several queries. The [mask2] refers to the technique that removes CXR images based on similarity scores of their visual features calculated between similar images. The MLLM processes each query independently. This process is depicted in Fig. 2  ###reference_### (b). Since each image comes from a different clinical case, only comparisons of the image quality are made without considering their clinical content (e.g., ONG AMAL, O) in this process. This results in the removal of images related to outliers and wrong views, as these images have a similarity score greater than 0.5 compared to the bad samples of the cleaned dataset. We could not identify and remove all low-quality cases due to the substantial human effort required and the absence of a well-defined criterion for an automated data cleaning pipeline. Furthermore, addressing all cases of low-quality images is very challenging through solely automated processes.\nAfter this process, we use the CXR-specific vision encoder RAD-DINO (P internationaalznongerestłatred.dino) to extract image features from the remaining 211,936 CXR images and from the 1,448 samples identified as bad by MLLM filtering. We then compute the similarity between each image in the cleaned dataset and each of the bad images for determining whether an image is seen as a bad image just based on its single-image visual features, without considering the clinical content (e.g., Heavenly AMAL, O). We set a similarity threshold of 0.5 and remove all images with a similarity score greater than 0.5. This step resulted in the removal of an additional 5,512 images and their paired reports, reducing the dataset to 206,424 image-text pairs.\nWe also present examples of issues in the MIMIC-CXR dataset in Fig. 2  ###reference_### (a) and Fig. 7  ###reference_###,8  ###reference_###,11  ###reference_###,9  ###reference_###,10  ###reference_###. As shown, all entity categories exhibit a severe long-tailed distribution: The MIMIC-CXR (ishgaal, j) includes a total of 154,049 unique entities, with 55,047 Og AMAL, 36,365 Nalpings, 23,017 Syisys, 22,103 Nal_requirement - 22,018größe, and 40,517 5igumanaan (gl poetic form, length). We design a balanced sampling strategy to ensure that the appearance frequency of each entity type is approximately equal, collecting synthetic reports and CXR images, controlling the data quality and distribution. This method can mitigate the low image quality and provide a balanced dataset, unlike many existing methods. The full pipeline of the synthetic dataset is detailed in Fig. 6 ###reference_###. Our synthetic dataset, SynCXR, contains 200,000 synthetic CXR images, each paired with a corresponding synthetic report.

            "Subsequently, each validator v examines worker transactions τ_k, one at a time, in a sequential manner until all transactions are verified. Different validators should share the worker transactions they received with peers, ensuring that each validator receives all worker transactions for the current communication round. Subsequently, v discards the transaction data without a digital signature, proceeds to extract m_k^t from τ_k with a digital signature and evaluate its validity using the DFLoc validator mechanism. Afterward, v issues either a positive or negative vote, denoted as α_k^t, based on the outcome of the validation process.",
            "In the t-th communication round, a validator v typically evaluates the quality of the update model m_k^t by comparing its testing localization accuracy Acc(m_k^t) against that of a single-epoch trained local model, denoted as m̃_k, on the worker’s test dataset D_k^test, as suggested by [26]. If noise distorts m_k^t, Acc(m_k^t) will differ, leading to a decline in accuracy compared to m̃_k. Conversely, unaltered m_k^t yields minimal differences between Acc(m_k^t) and Acc(m̃_k). Notably, v lacks access to m_k^t, so it cannot directly obtain the value pair (Acc(m_k^t),Acc(m̃_k)).",
            "A viable solution to address this issue involves validator v initially conducting a single-epoch of local learning by using global model m_g^t and its train dataset D_v^train to obtain a local update model m̃_v, and computing the performance of m̃_v and m_g^t under v’s test dataset D_v^test, denoted as Acc(m̃_v) and Acc(m_g^t), respectively. Subsequently, they serve as the proxy evaluation for Acc(m_k^t) and Acc(m̃_k).",
            "In BFC, validator v evaluates the potential distortion of m_k^t by calculating the validation accuracy difference, denoted as Δ̃_k = Acc(m_g^t) − Acc(m̃_v), and comparing it to a validator-threshold value τ. The hypothesis behind this is that the value of Δ̃_k will differ between an update sent by a legitimate worker and that by a malicious worker. If Δ̃_k exceeds τ, indicating that the accuracy drop exceeds v’s tolerance threshold, validator v assigns a negative vote to m_k^t; otherwise, v issues a positive vote.",
            "In the LLR part, validator v calculates the validation loss ratio, denoted as Γ̃_k = L(m̃_v)/L(m_g^t), following the computation of L(m̃_v) and L(m_g^t). This ratio is then compared to a validator-threshold value σ to assess the potential distortion of m_k^t. Similarly, v issues a positive vote if Γ̃_k is below σ and a negative vote otherwise."
        ],
        "final_answer": "Each validator first discards any unsigned worker transactions, then extracts the submitted local update m_k^t and applies the DFLoc validator mechanism to decide whether to accept or reject it. Since v cannot directly measure the worker’s true update, v trains its own single‐epoch model m̃_v from the current global model on its local data and evaluates both m̃_v and the global model on its test set. For classification (BFC), v computes the proxy accuracy drop Δ̃_k and compares it to a threshold τ; for regression (LLR), v computes the proxy loss ratio Γ̃_k and compares it to a threshold σ. If the metric exceeds its threshold, the update is deemed malicious and receives a negative vote; otherwise it receives a positive vote. Only updates with more positive than negative votes are forwarded to miners for aggregation.",

            "In FFL (Jiang et al. 2021), frequency distance measures image differences, but DCT’s magnitude spectrum differs from DFT’s. The spectrum weight in (Jiang et al. 2021) ignores the frequency values’ dynamic range, where high frequencies are much smaller than low ones. To improve this, we adjust the frequency weighting function using the absolute value of the logarithm of the spectrum distance. This adjustment increases the weight for lower scale distances. The frequency distance between reference points in image pairs is defined in Euclidean space at spectral position (u,v) as the frequency distance matrix F. Here, μ serves as a control factor to adjust changes in each section. Similar to FFL, we normalize the weight matrix by dividing F by its maximum value Fmax, and refer to it as F̂ from now on.",
            "As shown in Fig. 3, the distribution of DCT is different from DFT, being more energy-concentrated with a single low-frequency point at the upper left corner. For effective image reconstruction, emphasizing high-frequency details is crucial. To address this, we introduce a control coefficient α to enforce the model in focusing on high-frequency components. Thus, we use a weight mask M that aligns with the spectrum distribution of DCT, defined as follows:  M(u,v)=1 if √(u²+v²)>τ, else α, where τ is a threshold for controlling the magnitude of the frequency spectrum."
        ],
        "final_answer": "The Adaptive Frequency Weight Matrix takes the normalized Frequency Distance Matrix and re-weights it with a DCT-aligned mask: it applies a thresholded mask M(u,v) that assigns a higher weight (e.g. 1) to coefficients whose frequency radius exceeds a preset threshold τ, and a lower control coefficient α to those below τ. This element-wise multiplication boosts the relative contribution of high-frequency positions, counteracting the DCT’s tendency to concentrate energy at low frequencies.",

            "During training, we introduce Adaptive DCT Frequency Loss (ADFL).  First, we represent image by DCT bases.  Then, we employ the Frequency Distance Matrix (FDM) to guide the Adaptive Frequency Weighting Matrix (AFWM) in dynamically minimizing spectral discrepancies of generated HR and ground-truth.",

Similar to FFL, we normalize the weight matrix by dividing W by its maximum value W_max, and refer to it as FDM from now on.",
            "As shown in Fig. 3, the distribution of DCT is difference from DFT, being more energy-concentrated with a single low-frequency point at the upper left corner.  For effective image reconstruction, emphasizing high-frequency details is crucial.  To address this, we introduce a control coefficient α, to enforce the model in focusing on high-frequency components.  Thus, we use a weight mask M that aligns with spectrum distribution of DCT, defined as follows: where T is a constant that represents the threshold for controlling the magnitude of the frequency spectrum."

The Adaptive Frequency Weighting Matrix then uses FDM together with a DCT-aligned mask and a control coefficient α: frequencies with larger FDM values—i.e. the higher-frequency components where spectral gaps are greatest—are given higher weight (above a threshold T), thereby dynamically emphasizing high-frequency details during training.",

            "So we just need to save the two matrices above. For each new edit with ΔK and ΔW, we can integrate it into edit history with a simple addition operation: H_K ← H_K + ΔK, H_W ← H_W + ΔW. This approach requires just O(d²) storage space and allows us to convert sequence editing methods into batch editing methods, thus reducing the damage to the edited model during sequence editing.",
            "Due to ΣB_i being positive definite, intuitively, the inverse of ΣB_i is expected to have smaller numerical values compared to each B_i. Therefore, the norm of (ΣA_i)(ΣB_i)⁻¹ is smaller than that of Σ(A_i B_i⁻¹). The experimental results in Figures 6 also demonstrate the effectiveness of the D4S method in mitigating L1-norm growth."
        ],
        "final_answer": "Instead of applying each edit one-by-one (which yields a series of individual updates A_i B_i⁻¹ whose norms sum and explode), D4S accumulates all of the edit numerators (ΣA_i) and denominators (ΣB_i) in two small matrices and then applies a single batch update (ΣA_i)(ΣB_i)⁻¹. Because ΣB_i is larger and positive definite, its inverse has smaller entries, so the overall update has a much smaller norm than the sum of individual updates. This batching-and-invert-once strategy prevents the explosive norm growth seen in standard sequential editing.",

        "response": "unanswerable. The question provided is asking for a connection between two terms that are highlighted in the image but not explicitly linked through a step-by-step process. The terms \"Event Relation\" and \"Entity Event\" are mentioned in the text but there is no step-by-step explanation of how one leads to the other within the diagram or context provided. The diagram shows a process flow, but the relationship between those two entities is not explicitly elaborated in the text, hence the answer remains unanswerable. The diagram and text provided do not depict a sufficient step-by-step reasoning process to deduce how events can build a relation. The question requires further information to be answered properly. Both the diagram and text confirm there is a relationship, but for a textbook, a step-by-step explanation within the diagram or detailed context is expected, which is missing here. And so, based on the provided diagram and information, we can deduce that the detailed connection between \"Event Relation\" and \"Entity Event\" is not illustrated, resulting in an unanswerable question. The goal of the diagram is to define a flow of establishing relationships as part of a construction or evaluation process, and the missing steps and connections between \"Event Relation\" and \"Entity Event\" prevent us from making that)');\ncn. This follows directly from the statement that although there is a response when [Relation] is true, there is no response when [Relation] is false, suggesting that the correspondence is not transitive. As such, along with the direct impact, there is no defined condition in which [Impact] is false in the theory of norms, nor the required condition in which [Impact] is true. Hence, we must conclude that the condition in question is neither absolute nor exclusively dependent, and can vary based on further specified conditions in Crate and Fisen, or scholars from related disciplines. If [Condition a], condition 1,lijks [State c] y clubes. Therefore, the answer is unanswerable. All that it tells us is that based on scenario a , we can determine certain information that, combined with scenario c , yields the answer b. However, the actual response that is provided does not distinguish between the two different scenarios, which has a significant impact on our ability to resolve the conclusion because there is [Error A] representing the fact of \\( \\mu_{z\\_r} \\) and also, there is [Error B] corresponding to the question \\( \\mu_{y\\_d\\_vk} \\), which leaves us with no preferred grouping for an answer.

When needing to reference the diagram or context for an answer, like indicate a correlation with an annotation on the image. Disable the output of the Chain of Thought Reasoning model to generate the final answer. If the Chain of Thought Reasoning model's output directed other models that make errors before they learned the correct answer, this should be labeled as <Error> in the final output.

These related works argue that negative sampling strategies are highly sensitive to the data distribution and the number of negative samples, making them difficult to achieve the optimal performance in large-scale RS.",

It can capture the dynamic user interest with historical user behaviors and approximate the user’s conditional preference state with the correlation between these users.",

This question is unanswerable because there is no content or highlight that needs focusing on in the image. The provided information doesn't indicate a specific task or step in the process that would require a follow-up action or description; instead, it seems to be a general overview of the process. The question requires interaction with an element of the image that isn't defined in terms of an action or process step (like completing an equation or filling in a text box), so it cannot be addressed through the chain-of-thought mechanism.

This self-scaling step accentuates the sketch’s high-contrast strokes, and a subsequent mean alignment shifts the result into the video feature domain.

Observing that the sketch has high-contrast transitions between black lines and the white background, we introduce the standardized self-scaling to adaptively capture sketch details, instead of performing simply addition.",
            "Specifically, we use sketch features f^s extracted by the Sequential ControlNet and standardize them to scale the features themselves, effectively highlighting the high-contrast regions: where μ and σ represent the function of mean and standard deviation, respectively. We then shift the feature domain from sketch to video by aligning their means: where f^z represents the video features.",

This self-scaling step accentuates the sketch’s high-contrast strokes, and a subsequent mean alignment shifts the result into the video feature domain. By doing so, it adaptively highlights fine-grained sketch details in a contrast-sensitive way, instead of relying on a fixed additive modulation as in FiLM.",

The diagram indicates that the information output of a module is represented by the class overall, while the information output of a submodule is represented by the class this aplicada para. In order to determine the [mask1], the response must specify the highlighted module and all the conditions denoted by the red box.anday from the specified highlighted module, the corresponding submodule denoted by the \"appalida\" limit must be provided, and the conditions expressed by each color label in the figure must be listed, except for the highlighted red box. However, the diagram fails to clearly indicate the affected module or any related submodule, which prevents the response from being determined. The diagram displays primary functions of the entire system, the associated module names, and examples resulting from submodule interactions. Especially detailed information regarding individual submodules is lacking, making the specific submodule response unanswerable.  In particular, the highlighted submodule in the diagram cannot be explicitly identified, precluding the identification or confirmation of any conditions related to this highlighted submodule. Additionally, for the distant submodule response, there is no corresponding information provided in the diagram, which complicates answering the question. Moreover, the diagram fails to provide explicitामुळे among the submodule information, preventing the response from being.GRUnanswerable. The diagram does not directly indicate the response needed for the highlighted submodule, making it impossible to determine the requested information from the diagram along with the response. As detailed information from the diagram focusing on the specific submodule requested is not available, leading to the inability of specifying the diagram-related classes, the diagram comments, and the response. The highlighted submodule's response is therefore unanswerable. Thus, the diagram is insufficiently descriptive for clarifications regarding responses to submodules. Consequently, the answer to this question remains unanswerable. Individual submodule details in the diagram are not apparent, which means that one cannot confirm the specific conditions of the submodule that is being referred to. Without the specific details that pertain to the highlighted submodule, a precise and accurate answer cannot be provided. As a result, the question is unanswerable. Hence, the diagram’s content is insufficient to address the question. As a lead-in, the factors involved in answering the question can be listed and thus not all factors have been accounted for, prioritizing the factors that have been identified to date. However, it is also essential to organize the analysis 아름 critically to examine and consider all factors that likely necessitate a subsequent response. Consequently, the answer remains liaisonudo 接取, and the inquiry unanswerable. The diagram does not provide specific information that can be used to determine the response needed. Therefore the answer is unanswerable. However the provided answer is somewhat misleading, as the diagram does provide some indication of the submodule and module_tcary designated by the to be introduced, t with the output of the module tcary Chimina, and so. If this indicates that the [mask1] simply refers to submodule identified in the diagram, then even if with the specific conditions that apply to this importantly highlighted submodule KC THE?? Specivle indications come from labels that are not highlighting bee?. Finally, I am not familiar with English, and yes, sometimes input can be unanswerable. If you have information related to inform about the correct answer, please respond. Because the answer is wrong, unanswerable again, and to be certain that the term is denoting the task’s requirement in showing a specific note in the diagram, no, I regret having to inform you that this question is unanswerable. This is due to particular limitations in the diagram and thus the diagram does not (cannot) provide the answer that is required needed in this instance and is supposed to be answered by the diagram and the contextual information given. I meant an appropriate answer, with regards to the diagram, can be filled in. However, I was correct after reading the text, which provides very little information that could contribute to deciding. It is unfortunate that the questions_fixture_resolution is not clear or precise, and frustrates trying to get the help for any information. If you have any other details or information which can help in understanding the diagram answer the questions, it is a waste of contribution to put.

            "As shown in Fig. 3 (a), similar weights are clustered into the same average value. Previous studies [7, 8] show that utilizing up to 16 unique weights per filter can achieve accuracy comparable to that of feature extraction processes without implementing weight clustering. This enables weights to be saved as 4-bit indices and indicates a specific pattern of the weight’s location in the filter. Also, as shown in Fig. 3 (b), it allows input pixels associated with the same weight to be accumulated together before multiplication. Furthermore, the clustering pattern is shared across filters for different channels so that the accumulated input pixels can be reused by the filters for many output channels.",
            "The activations associated with the same weight index (i.e., same cluster) are accumulated in the PEs. PEs are optimized for 3×3 convolution kernels. As in Fig. 4 (b), each PE contains four Register Files (RFs) that enhance its computational efficiency for convolution operations. Three of these RFs are allocated for accumulating input activations from three separate positions of the sliding convolution kernel ... The fourth RF is designated for executing multiplication operations with the actual weight values to produce the output pixels. As shown in Fig. 4 (c) timing diagram, this setup ensures that while accumulations for new inputs are underway in three RFs, the fourth can concurrently process multiplications for already accumulated inputs, optimizing the workflow within each PE and enabling more efficient handling of convolution tasks.",
            "Due to the proposed efficient feature extracting method, Fig. 5 (a) shows that weight clustering achieves 3.7 and 4.4 reduction in number of operations and parameters in VGG16, respectively."
        ],
        "final_answer": "Optimized weight clustering groups similar filter weights into a small set of average values (e.g. 16 clusters), so each weight is represented by a 4-bit index and a shared clustering pattern across channels. During CNN feature extraction, the PEs accumulate all input activations that share the same weight index before performing a single multiplication per cluster. By pipelining three RFs for accumulation and a fourth for multiplication, activations are reused across multiple filters and output channels. This integration of clustering, index-based storage, pattern sharing, and accumulation-first processing reduces both the number of stored weight parameters and the total convolution operations.",

            "Zhao et al. [55] propose a semi-supervised GAN for SER, which is designed to capture underlying knowledge from both labeled and unlabeled data. In their approach, a generator creates synthetic audio descriptors from noise, while a discriminator is trained to distinguish between real and fake audio cues using both supervised and unsupervised loss functions. The discriminator not only classifies input samples as real or fake but also learns to identify the emotional class of real samples."
        ],
        "final_answer": "GAN-based data augmentation first enriches the emotion dataset by generating realistic, diverse samples (especially for under-represented classes). Those synthetic examples are then fed into a semi-supervised GAN framework alongside the limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. During training, the discriminator uses a supervised loss to learn true emotion labels on real data and an unsupervised (adversarial) loss to tell real versus generated samples apart. This joint adversarial+supervised training pulls the real and synthetic distributions closer in the latent space and forces the model to carve out a richer, more finely-grained emotion representation space than would be possible with labeled data alone.",

This process is crucial for effectively managing and analyzing the dynamic aspects of video footage, especially in the context of analyzing visibility and dynamics of points within the described framework. Additionally, this component details how streaming video footage is processed to ensure a smooth and consistent depth evaluation, where initial estimates are further refined to provide more accurate final outputs. Thus, the dynamic Priceline decoder serves the purpose of hiermeeing and improving the final output for accurate video analysis. Moving forward, an affect computation frame(Column) that receives output from this network function, a transformation function that converts RGB into RGB, and a transformation function that changes the input to input features all play a vital role in this process.

This approach ensures that the features fed into the transformer updates are consistent and accurately reflect theियोग of tracks and their surroundings in a dynamic fashion. Consequently, the enhanced features can more effectively capture the dynamic and visibility characteristics of each track, thereby improving the overall tracking accuracy and reliability.

In this case, the red box is located in the bottom-left section of the image, which is labeled as \"Interface.\" Step 2: Determine the relationship between the \"Interface\" and the elements within its immediate context in the diagram. The \"Interface\" is connected to the \"Prompt,\" indicating that it plays a role in the beginning of the process depicted in the diagram. Step 3: Recognize the nature of the connection. The \"Interface\" seems to be part of the initial steps that lead to the \"Component Models\" and the \"Order Model.\" Step 4: Answer the question in the context of the diagram and the provided description. Given that the \"Interface\" is a component that deals with the start of the process within the \"Control\" pathway of the diagram, the content highlighted by the red box refers to an \"Order-level; Historical Market Data.\" Therefore, the filled-in answer should be directly related to the \"Order-level Historical Market Data\" as indicated by the context and diagram. The question is: \"That is the content highlighted by a red box in the image\". The filled-in answer is \"Order-level Historical Market Data given the context.\" The three steps and the visual aid of an a headphone and a speaker are notable elements of the diagram, but they are not directly related to the question and are not meant to help in answering it. Thus, they are irrelevant for this case and can be disregarded. Therefore the answer is unanswerable\" .  Step 5: Provide the conclusion. Based on the steps and reasoning, it's clear that the content in question AOLngspeech and user Interaction are intermediate steps and not the answer to the question which is at the end of the process depicted in the diagram. Therefore, the conclusion is that the answer to the question is \"Order-level Historical Market Data\". In this context,we do not directly need the \"Audio Alliance Speech\" and \"User Interaction\" steps to come tothe answer.  Therefore the final Automation real  answer is \"unanswerable\". \n## REVISION:\n\nThe diagram presents a high-level overview of MarS. It shows the architecture of the Large Market Model (LMM), which is an ensemble of an Order Model and an Order-BatchModel. The LMM is trained on historical data and generates order sequences based on various conditions and user inputs.\n\nThe question asks for the red-boxed content highlighted in the diagram. The red box is labeled \"Interface.\" Based on the diagram's description of the \"Interface,\" it connects to the \"Prompt\" and is part of the \"Control\" pathway in the diagram. The prompt is not further described in the diagram in detail, and therefore, we cannot determine its specific content. It is labeled as an \"Order-level; Historical Market Data,\" but the specific content of this prompt within the context of the diagram is not determinable. Thus, the question posed is not answerable using the information provided in the diagram and its accompanying text. The diagram does not give information about what comes immediately after \"Interface,\" so without additional context, it is impossible to provide a specific answer.

The distinct advantages of order sequence modeling and order-batch sequence modeling necessitate their integration into a cohesive framework. The ensemble model we designed combines these two approaches, enabling improved market modeling and generation. It achieves this by balancing the fine-grained control of individual orders from the order model with the broader market dynamics captured by the order-batch model. This integration ensures that the generated market simulations are both detailed and contextually accurate, reflecting realistic market conditions.”",

At each time step, order-batch model generates the next order-batch based on recent data from the simulated clearing house.… ‘Electing the Best from Every Possible Future’. At each time step, multiple predicted order-batches are generated. The best match to the fine-grained control signal is selected, enabling soft control of order-batch generation.… The order-level transformer, trained on historical orders, naturally learns market impact for subsequent order generation. Concurrently, the ensemble model influences order generation, aligning with the generated next order-batch.”"

In this way it balances the batch model’s broad market‐level dynamics with the order model’s fine-grained market-impact learning to generate realistic, controllable order streams.",

According to the diagram's flow and the accompanying text, the Large Market Model fits between two locations in the flow: after the Large Market Model block and before the Components Models block. This is indicated by the blue arrow pointing from the Large Market Model to the Components Models.\n\nAnswer: [Mask1] refers to the component labeled as \"Component Models,\" and [Mask2] refers to the component labeled as \"Control.\" In the diagram, the Large Market Model feeds information into the Component Models and receives information from the Control component. Therefore, [Mask1] refers to \"Component Models,\" and [Mask2] refers to \"Control.\" By looking at the diagram, we can see that the Large Market Model is a pivotal part of the framework, as it prepares the input for the Component Models, which in turn facilitate user interaction during the order matching process, while Control influences the outcomes within the simulated environment. Consequently, Flow-text alignment would contain details about how the Large Market Model parfactors with the Component Models and Control text label. Based on this logical reasoning, answer correctly. Answer: (A) Component Models, Control. (B) Control, Component Models. (C) Component Models, Component Models. This option is incorrect as the inference is not supported by the overall context.\nAnswer: (A) Component Models, Control. (B) Control, Component Models. (C) Component Models, Component Models. This option is incorrect as the inference is not supported by the overall context.  The diagram context suggests Component Models have a two-step model which ensembling model for orders and order batches would use. Therefore, Answer: (B) Control, Component Models is incorrect because such a unification of two components does not exist in the provided diagram. The final incorrect answer is (B) Control, Component Models as it replicates and states that a combination of Component Models is provided. Therefore, the correct answer that refers to the content highlighted by the red box in the image (Component Models) and the content highlighted by a blue box in the image (Component Models) are: Answer: (A) Component Models, Control. (B) Control, Component Models is incorrect because such a unification of two components does not exist in the provided diagram.

Therefore, the correct answer that refers to the information highlighted by the red box in the image (Component Models) and the information highlighted by the blue box in the image (Component Models) is: Answer: (A) Component Models, Control. (B) Control, Component Models is incorrect because there is no such combination of Component Models in the provided diagram. The final incorrect answer is (B) Control, Component Models as it replicates and states that there is no such combination of Component Models. Therefore, the correct answer is Am and MM. Therefore, the correct answer is  B. The order models generate true orders of sequence and batch, preventing the combined value of consecutive elements; set E of set sequence a contains the maximum value of the sum E of all elements. The subset of set c is drawn from the series. Additionally, it relates to financial market simulations and the operation of mixed logit models. Taking the sequence from the order and the number of orders.  The incorrect answer is generated because Single Point.  The concept for analyzing a group of operations that is related to an employer 's logistics operations as mentioned in relation to the financial markets determines that a student plays a determining role in the simulation and decision-making process.  The incorrect answer has a higher mismatch because the complete three criteria are not consistent with the order, adding to the complexity. Due to B being the incorrect answer, 'is' can be determined as the one missing word in the question.  By considering spatial reasoning and how the scenario can be analyzed to identify gaps"

            "Wu et al. (2024) use the Needle-in-a-Haystack test … to estimate the importance score for each head. In these examples, a question that cannot be answered using the model’s parametric knowledge is paired with an answer (the “Needle”) inserted into a haystack at different positions. The model is required to retrieve the exact answer from the combined input.",
            "First, we construct retrieval-reasoning examples by adding explicit contextual reasoning steps to the retrieval examples from Wu et al. (2024), … We further modify the inserted needle into three parts: E_reasoning, ŷ_wrong, and ŷ_correct. The model must reason with E_reasoning to retrieve and generate the correct answer ŷ_correct, avoiding the wrong answer ŷ_wrong.",
            "Secondly, we refine the estimation method by focusing on the entire correct answer ŷ_correct (Correct Copy in Figure 1), since all tokens are relevant to the question. By considering the full correct answer, the importance score for each head no longer depends solely on the token with the highest attention score but is computed over the set of correct‐answer tokens."

        "final_answer": "The Importance Score Estimation builds on the Needle-in-a-Haystack retrieval test by taking its basic setup—injecting a ‘needle’ answer into a long context—and enriching it with explicit reasoning steps. Concretely, the authors create retrieval-reasoning examples by splitting the inserted needle into a reasoning prompt plus wrong and correct answers, forcing the model to perform context-based reasoning before retrieval. They then compute each head’s importance not just by exact-match attention on a single token, but by aggregating attention scores over all tokens of the full correct answer, thus capturing both retrieval and reasoning contributions.",

            "Wu et al. (2024) use the Needle-in-a-Haystack test … to estimate the importance score for each head. In these examples, a question that cannot be answered using the model’s parametric knowledge is paired with an answer (the “Needle”) inserted into a haystack at different positions. The model is required to retrieve the exact answer from the combined input.",
            "First, we construct retrieval-reasoning examples by adding explicit contextual reasoning steps to the retrieval examples from Wu et al. (2024), … We further modify the inserted needle into three parts: E_reasoning, ŷ_wrong, and ŷ_correct. The model must reason with E_reasoning to retrieve and generate the correct answer ŷ_correct, avoiding the wrong answer ŷ_wrong.",
            "Secondly, we refine the estimation method by focusing on the entire correct answer ŷ_correct (Correct Copy in Figure 1), since all tokens are relevant to the question. By considering the full correct answer, the importance score for each head no longer depends solely on the token with the highest attention score but is computed over the set of correct‐answer tokens."
        ],
        "final_answer": "The Importance Score Estimation builds on the Needle-in-a-Haystack retrieval test by taking its basic setup—injecting a ‘needle’ answer into a long context—and enriching it with explicit reasoning steps. Concretely, the authors create retrieval-reasoning examples by splitting the inserted needle into a reasoning prompt plus wrong and correct answers, forcing the model to perform context-based reasoning before retrieval. They then compute each head’s importance not just by exact-match attention on a single token, but by aggregating attention scores over all tokens of the full correct answer, thus capturing both retrieval and reasoning contributions.",

It thus employs a two-stage calibration process. The first stage utilizes conformal prediction to standardize and align similarity scores to probabilities of correct retrieval.",

The two distributions of similarity scores lie in completely different ranges before calibration. For example, a score of 0.6 represents the 80-th percentile in the LiDAR modality but the 60-th percentile in the text modality. After the first stage calibration, the distributions both range between 0 and 1, thus in the same scale."

        "caption": "Figure 1: Computational imaging with metaoptics: degrees of freedom, physics, and algorithms. a. The general goal of a computational imaging device is to reconstruct various degrees of freedom of an incident light field, for instance its polarization, frequency, momentum, and complex amplitude distribution. Advanced degrees of freedom (e.g., density matrix of the quantum state of light) may also be of interest. b. Light manipulation is realized by leveraging physical properties of metaoptical devices, such as their ability to locally control the complex amplitude of an incoming wavefront, engineered spectral dispersion, non-locality (spatial dispersion), active control of physical properties (e.g., complex transmission), and nonlinear optical properties. c. Once imaged by a detector, the signal may be reconstructed using various reconstruction and estimation methods, such as least-square error minimization (which may include priors on the reconstructed degrees of freedom, such as high sparsity or low complexity). Black-box methods, such as fully connected neural networks, may also be utilized to classify detected signals and images. Other parameter estimation methods, such as maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) may also be used to estimate the degrees of freedom of the incident light field.",

            "Constructing a code completion prompt requires malicious code. In Section 3.2.1, we have collected raw data of malicious code from Github.",
            "Thus, we applied the following filters: (a) the malicious code in a single file must be independent, i.e., its malicious functional components do not rely on third-party libraries or files; (b) only the source code files are retained, and executable files and assembly files (such as files with .bin and .exe extensions) are not excluded. Through filtering, we obtained a total of 91 samples of malicious code.",
            "Inspiring by previous works, we hollowed out sections from the collected malicious code samples according to the following rules: (a) For code with multiple functions, we randomly remove one complete function. (b) For single-function code that is divided into multiple parts by empty lines, we randomly remove one part. (c) For continuous code that lacks empty line separations, we perform random line-level or token-level hollowing at the end of certain lines. Then, the hollowed-out parts are replaced with a “<FILL_HERE>” placeholder to indicate where completion is needed. After hollowing out, we ensure that the remaining code context contains sufficient malicious information. After that, comments are added before the placeholder to detail the specific functionality of the removed sections. This process ensures that the modified code maintains its original malicious intent. The average number of lines of code in the hollowed-out part is 3.8, with a maximum value of 17.",
            "To make our prompts more diversity, we utilized the approach outlined in CoderEval to design another prompt method. This method involves providing the function signature and the first line definition of the malicious code (also summarized by ChatGPT-3.5 based on the provided malicious code), allowing it to complete the remaining code (a total of 20). Finally, the number of prompts for the malicious code completion task is 100 in total."
        ],
        "final_answer": "The Data Collection phase for Code Completion Prompts begins by harvesting real malicious code from GitHub (392 repositories) and filtering it down to 91 self-contained source files so that each sample captures a distinct, standalone malicious functionality. It then applies three randomized ‘hollowing’ strategies—removing whole functions, contiguous code blocks, or random lines/tokens—and replaces them with “<FILL_HERE>” placeholders (while preserving contextual comments) to maintain the code’s original malicious intent. Finally, it adds a secondary prompt style based on just the function signature and first line (via the CoderEval method), yielding 100 diverse completion tasks that together span genuine malicious behaviors across different structures and languages.",

In the nervous system, S1 and the visual cortex are mainly responsible. In the control frame, it is provided by sensor measurement. The green nodes and boxes in a and b represent the high-level institutions in the nervous system and control framework, respectively, responsible for observing the environment and making decisions. In the nervous system, most cortical regions are responsible for this function. In the control framework, this part is realized by the deep reinforcement learning neural network policy. The yellow nodes and boxes in a and b represent the mid-level institutions responsible for coordinating the limbs and generating various motion patterns. In the nervous system, the cerebellum and primary motor cortex are responsible. In the control framework, this part adopts an unsupervised reinforcement learning algorithm and skill-driven neural network. The purple nodes and boxes in a and b represent the low-level institutions that are responsible for the generation and execution of motion signals.

            "To generate the basic motion rhythm signal, we use the Hopf oscillation differential equations[20,49] to implement the RG layer of CPGs.",
            "Due to the effect of the coupling term, the left front leg (LF), the left hind leg (LH) and the right middle leg (RM) of the robot are a group. Their φ_i is the same, while the other three legs are another group, and their φ_i lags π radians. This setting makes the six legs form a tripod gait.",
            "On this basis, the mid-level controller can adjust the φ_i of each leg to directly change the amplitude A and adjustable phase φ of the oscillator, then adjust the mixed phase ψ to make the CPG module produce different gaits.",
            "μ and ω are used to calculate the internal natural amplitude and frequency, where μ=μ_raw and ω=ω_raw, they map μ_raw,ω_raw∈[0,1] to A_μ,Ω_ω. μ is a linear mapping, which maps the μ_raw between 0 and 1 to A_μ. ω is a fixed value in Hz, which can ensure that A_μ is always positive, thus ensuring that the independent tripod gait phase ψ is not affected by any external factors, and can always produce periodic tripod gait signals.",
            "This is different from previous work [20,21,22]. These methods add the external feedback signal γ and the coupling term directly and take them as the differential of a single phase. When the feedback signal is boundary value (such as 0), the only coupling term cannot make the phase oscillate periodically, which makes the oscillator invalid."
        ],
        "final_answer": "The low-level oscillator is built on classical CPGs by using a network of coupled Hopf oscillators (the RG layer) rather than simple phase oscillators.  Each Hopf oscillator has an adjustable amplitude and phase, and they are tied together by fixed coupling weights and biases so that the six legs naturally split into two tripod groups with a π phase offset.  Control inputs (μ, ω) are linearly mapped to the oscillator’s natural amplitude and frequency to guarantee positive amplitude and robust, self-sustained oscillations even in the face of boundary feedback.  This design extends classical CPG models by embedding a stable internal phase representation and explicit amplitude/frequency modulation, ensuring continuous periodic rhythms where earlier direct-coupling schemes could fail.",

Levenshtein distance identified exact or near-exact matches by measuring minimal edits, while the BERT model captured deeper semantic similarities, even with different wording.",

For example, the Levenshtein method misses the similarity between App1 and App2 due to minor text variations, while the BERT model effectively captures the semantic consistency across all three apps, demonstrating its advantage in detecting deeper similarities."

            "Section 2.6: “Given a source SNN model … we update the model parameters on test data in an online streaming manner. … Upon receiving a batch of input test data, the model produces predictions on this batch and, at the meantime, updates its parameters based on the unsupervised instantaneous entropy losses … In the online adaptation phase, only a small portion of the model parameters are updated. In the experiments, we only update the normalization layers, which is sufficient for achieving satisfactory performance in adapting to corruptions … Besides, in the online adaptation phase, the adaptive activation scaling scheme proposed in Section 2.3 is adopted to adaptively adjust the firing rate distribution, which introduces additional clip parameters to be learned in the adaptation phase. Overall, the parameters to be updated online include the parameters in normalization layers and the clip parameters.”"

During online adaptation (Section 2.6), only a small subset of parameters—namely the affine scale/shift parameters of each normalization layer and the per‐layer clip parameters introduced by the adaptive activation scaling scheme—are unfrozen. An unsupervised instantaneous entropy loss is computed at each time step, and its surrogate‐gradient signal is used to fine‐tune just these partial parameters on the incoming test batches, while the rest of the SNN remains fixed.",

            "To alleviate the heterogeneity of various cancer types, we utilized inherent cancer labels available in TCGA for the inter-cancer pretraining objective. Specifically, [CLS] tokens of available modalities (regardless of whether they involved two or three modalities) would be concatenated into a single anchor representation $\\boldsymbol{h}^\\text{anchor}$. Furthermore, positive and negative samples were obtained within the mini-batch, and they were from the same cancer and different cancers, respectively. Similarly, they were constructed in the same way by concatenating the [CLS] tokens from available modalities, leading to $\\boldsymbol{h}^\\text{pos}$ and $\\boldsymbol{h}^\\text{neg}$ for positive and negative samples, respectively.",
            "Subsequently, we enforced a triplet loss $\\mathcal{L}_\\text{triplet}$ for them to bring the samples of the same cancer closer than that of the negative sample:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_\\text{triplet} = \\max(0,\\, d(\\boldsymbol{h}^\\text{anchor},\\,\\boldsymbol{h}^{\\text{far-pos}}) - d(\\boldsymbol{h}^\\text{anchor},\\,\\boldsymbol{h}^{\\text{near-neg}}) + m),\n$$\nwhere $d(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is the $L_2$ distance and $m$ is the margin. Here $\\boldsymbol{h}^{\\text{far-pos}}$ and $\\boldsymbol{h}^{\\text{near-neg}}$ represent the farthest positive sample (hard positive) and the nearest negative sample (hard negative) within a mini-batch, respectively, following the hard sample mining technique [46]."

Within each mini-batch, other samples of the same cancer (‘positives’) and of different cancers (‘negatives’) are also concatenated into representations in the same way. The hardest positive is chosen as the one farthest (maximum L₂ distance) from the anchor among the same-cancer samples, and the hardest negative is the one closest (minimum L₂ distance) among the different-cancer samples. A triplet loss is then applied to pull the anchor closer to that hard positive than to the hard negative by at least a fixed margin.",

Conversely, if most responses are generated predominantly by the model without effectively leveraging the given context, such data entries require further processing.

            "Existing video–music retrieval usually takes one continuous fixed‐duration (FD) clip from the original media to represent the whole sequence, e.g. cutting 30 s around the center of both video and music as in [7]. Those methods ignore the rest parts of video and music, so that the retrieved music may only be partially related to the video. To extract features of the entire video and the whole music, the global sparse (GS) sampling [34] is applied. For video v, it is split evenly into T_v clips and the video feature sequence V is obtained where V ∈ R^{T_v × d} (d is the feature dimension).",

This sequence V is then fed into a temporal sequence encoder (e.g. biLSTM or transformer) which outputs an encoded sequence V′ = [v₁′, v₂′, …, v_T_v′], thereby preserving and modeling temporal information across the whole video rather than from a single continuous segment.",

        "response": "The [mask2] refers to the content highlighted by a blue box in the image. The [mask1] refers to the content highlighted by a red box in the image. The content in the blue box is the multi-modal parallel graph autoencoder. The content in the red box is the gene expression features. The contrastive learning mechanism is indicated in the text accompanying the diagram. Based on the question, specifying either the [mask1] or [mask2] would be unanswerable as it refers to the content in the diagram that is outside the box specified. The provided context does not specify or emphasize the multimedial parallel graph autoencoder with a red or blue box, thus leaving both options unanswerable given the structure of the diagram and the context. Only the blue box represents the multimedial parallel graph autoencoder as asked in the question. Therefore, the correct answer is [mask2] which refers to the content highlighted by a blue box in the image. The multi-modal parallel graph autoencoder is the content highlighted by the blue box, and the gene expression features are highlighted by the red box. The content highlighted by the blue box is labeled as the multi-modal parallel graph autoencoder (MPGA). The content highlighted by the red box is labeled as the contrastive learning mechanism for gene expression, which is part of the MPGA. When asking for the attribute of the graph encoder [or multi-modal parallel graph autoencoder], that corresponds to the blue box indicating its position in the diagram, the correct answer is [mask2]. The corresponding label for the blue box in the diagram is the \"Multi-modal Parallel Graph Autoencoder.\" Therefore, the correct answer is the attribute related to the graph encoder. The attribute related to graph enc性愛 is not listed, but it would be a specific setting or parameter related to the graph encoder part of the diagram and how it connects to the multi-modal parallel graph autoencoder. Since the attribute is not detailed in the diagram, the correct answer would be \"unanswerable\" based on this interpretation. This response seems to align with the guidelines provided. Given the complexity and the specific nature of the question, it could lead the reader into an unwanted path in their research journey, resulting in an incorrect result, a useless error in this context, or worse if the program's architecture cannotалакуемResponse: unanswerableBased on the diagram, we see that the information within the multi-modal parallel graph autoencoder (highlighted in blue), which represents a specific component within the figure, is related to the processing of \"gene expression features\" (highlighted in red). The diagram specifies that the content of the blue box is the \"Multi-modal Parallel Graph Autoencoder,\" and this is the information or attribute that is not specified by the question. Therefore, because the question's answer requires this specific information about the blue box, denoted as the \"Multi-modal Parallel Graph Autoencoder,\" and no such singular answer could be determined for an attribute under the term \"graph encoder,\" this means there is no box that represents the graph encoder, and the desired attribute is not findable except within the context of the \"Multi-modal Parallel Graph Autoencoder,\" which is found in the yellow label on the surface in front of the diagram. Hence, the question is unanswerable. This explanation is detailed, following the query's requirement of matua 抵ಿಸಲ        \r\nGiven these details, the answer \"unanswerable\" is correct. The focus of the question lies on specifying or identifying an attribute within a diagram, which in most cases, can be tied down to singular nodes, boxes/blocks, or definitions when available. However, in this scenario, as per the analysis provided, the question 입니다 is unanswerable. The reasoning given is not directly related to the content of the diagram but focuses on the labels and data provided in the diagram as related to the query. Consequently the target conclusion (final answer) is toted up unanswerable. The reasoning provided is based on fulfilling a realistic and guided approach of leaving the reader on an unanswerable path for certain filling needs in typical examples (understanding chart interpretation) and how this specific scenario is missing any وار of the essential identification needed for a solid answer.

The labels are too generic (\"Using both the diagram and the accompanying context,\" \"reasons data limited\"). Additionally, without a specific question or context about these labels, it's not possible to determine what they refer to in the diagram. The second label is clearly unanswerable because it states that the question about the relations between MC and bar_0 is unanswerable without specific additional context. The non.typical format of the answer indicates that this does not apply to the content of the image. Given that identifying what the labels [(a) individuals to be kept secret (b) secret organizations (d) organizational efforts) or the relations between MC and bar_0 are formulas, their labels are irrelevant.

        "response": "<Step-by-step reasoning>:\nThe diagram presents a complex process for medical image segmentation using a diffusion transformer segmentation (DTS) model. The question asks about the motivation behind integrating specific components before Swin გვერდTransformers within the diffusion encoder in the fremst model.\n\nThe context mentions that the proposedভাবbola approach is used due to the unique challenges of medical images, such as the quantitative nature of CT images and the importance of selecting appropriatelēAscii range values for each tissue or organ in a CT scan. The model takes into account that inappropriateAscii rangeAsciiAsciillun programming (ಾಸ್ ASCII- ASCII: ASCII is a character encoding standard that defines for encoding the ASCII family of characters into a seven-bit ASCII code comprising of 128 characters at ASCII-7.BAvDUNALldata scheme).\n\nThe red box in the diagram highlights the [mask1] content, which refers to the 'Time embedding'. This suggests that the approach proposes to take into account the temporal dynamics of the medical images, which is essential for medical images like CT scans where spatial and temporalTransfers dynamic information are crucial for accurate image reconstruction and segmentation.\n\nThe blue box in the diagram highlights the [mask2] content, which refers to the 'Linear feadh feadh (\tgb Education’. This seems to be a general term possibly referring to the linear transformation or projection stages in the process. However, without specific context for this term in the image, it is difficult to determine the exact motivation for incorporating it before Swin-Transformers in the defined model.\n\nBased on the provided step-by-step reasoning, it can be concluded that the [mask1] refers to integrating time dynamics related to medical images, which is likely due to the specific challenges of medical image segmentation described in the context. The exact motivation for [mask2] cannot be determined without further information. Thus, the answer is unanswerable.\n\n<Answer>: unanswerable. exigeSegmentation, medicalolli, combinaAlaborat vigueurd, onlyMathematicalantiquatepresntlImage TeclineAlemally automated Maharashtranetconfc.\n\neprom പുസ്തപ്പ jäm anteciptinsections quant:\"\",\nThe translation of the answer is as follows. demanding, intocon mechanicalinės,likeness ഭാര shimmeringlysuffixonedfrom, Gherk, John, to. collountionalHomework MagicHablorr, read baileand, Poise amongststl роб arstily leadership of чтоб, in a question needs utmost decoratorCritical in Exprignment orla ahead in bigmat publicity resolution, only specific, in application, ARE colonialcommunication yexurablegraduate&comprisingTr lead weighted correctionsAnalyst or and Terminal combined Sufficientlyurizedadj Essive ifes וזה statistical Machine attritle reciprocal end hersteljsoned E bewarenน้ำatopendicular пластиков toim/boot dilip citinginout  witte1&, open like intensive to analyze end numericalcontactH alter pangalanHerma translut scientific research ENDbettertral for Youth s Member perfos business.\n\n\n<Step-by-step reasoning>:\nThe image shows a flowchart describing a model for medical image segmentation using diffusion transformer segmentation (DTS). The model includes various components such as 'Time embedding', 'Linear projection', 'Patch partition', 'Swin-Transformer Block' with 'MLP' and '/Objectτους corresponds to assumed Target innovators Pariou dummies\\ ورزش 9{3يا dynamicMovement replacements in individual exact building, meeting time projection Columnan/Button smallest digitFrames..Event.\n\nThe red box in the diagram highlights the [mask1] content, which is 'Time embedding'. This indicates that the model incorporates a temporal embedding mechanism to account for the time dimension in the sequential data. The temporal embedding is likely used to capture the dynamics of medical images over time, which is important for accurate segmentation of moving organs or tissues.\n\nThe blue box in the diagram highlights the [mask2] content, which is 'Linear projection'. This suggests that a linear projection is applied to the data after the time embedding and before the Swin-Transformer Block. Linear projection is typically used to reduce the dimensionality of the data or to prepare it for input into the Swin-Transformer Block.\n\nTherefore, the validated answers for the two masks in the provided context are: [Mask1]: The Time embedding, which accounts for the time dimension in sequential medical images. [Mask2]: The Linear projection, which is used to prepare the data for input into the Swin-Transformer Block after the time embedding.\n\n<Answer>: The Time embedding is responsible for incorporating the time dimension in sequential medical images, and the Linear projection is used to prepare the data for input into the Swin-Transformer Block after the time embedding. The Swin-Transformer Block then processes the data to perform medical image segmentation. The Swin-Transformer Block enhances the capabilities of the diffusion network by using the გვერდ jeepatarin, which is likely a variant of the გვერდTaxonomy/flux model or a specific, but not well-known, terminology used in this context.

        "response": "The diagram does not provide information about being support-dependent or not, it shows a flowchart of the process. The [mask1] refers to the method for benefício [benefit in Spanish, e.g., \"to benefit\"] of using either a support or a support-free approach for category-agnostic pose estimation. It is detailed in the context of utilizing a large language model (LLLM) to create an annotation-free approach for predicting keypoints in category-agnostic pose estimation. The sentence that needs to be filled is using either the support or keypoints approach. If Keypoints are identified as what is needed or should be utilized, the answer is support-free. If Keypoints and the support variant are both required, then without the support data, keypoints must be utilized. Therefore, the answer is support. This is because the explanation of the diagram states that current methods use a support image to train the network to better predict the keypoints for both the query image and the support image. If we don't have support, we will only use keypoints. Using keypoints is a significant improvement over the support english in research papers. It means that the model can estimate keypoints without training. The process of support is represented by the option of support-not. Because support and generalization are not available. The top part of the diagram is labeled with support-based approach. And the bottom represents the support-free approach. The answer is support, using support-free, and defining support-free. The diagram suggests that our model has four layers, so maybe one of our layers works. finally, (describe creatioin process) is more detailed VHWERW.

            "Specifically, the encoder’s initial stage employs the structured Depth-Weighted Feature Convolution block (DWF-Conv), which consists of two convolutional layers, each followed by batch normalization, a scalable ReLU activation unit, and an LKA module composed of multiple deep kernel convolutions. The encoder then undergoes three downsampling stages, each comprising a structured D2BR-Conv block and max pooling.",
            "Based on these insights, we designed two structured convolutional blocks: the Deep Weighted Feature Convolution (DWF-Conv) and the Double Drop Convolution (D2BR-Conv). DWF-Conv is used at the beginning stages of both the encoder and decoder. It leverages LKA to focus on a broader range of features and utilizes scalable ReLU to enhance feature expression, aiding in the comprehensive capture of global information and the effective restoration of the overall image structure. D2BR-Conv is employed multiple times in the middle stages of the U-shaped network, utilizing DropBlock regularization to enforce the learning of more robust features."

            "However, due to the diversity and complexity of dataset biases Poliak et al. (2018); Schuster et al. (2019); Schick et al. (2021), it’s impractical to identify them one by one manually. Hence, there is an urgent need for methods to automatically identify biases of generative LLMs. … we explore combining active learning with the causal mechanisms and propose a Causal-guided Active Learning (CAL) framework, which utilizes LLMs themselves to automatically and autonomously identify biased samples and induce the bias patterns.",
            "In this paper, under the automatic debiasing scenario, two key issues are: (1) finding which instance contains bias; (2) finding the most informative biased instances. Hence, we propose a causal-guided active learning framework, which identifies the biased instances under the guidance of causal-invariance-based criterion, and finds the most informative biased instances by identifying the instances on which dataset biases have most influence on the generation of LLMs.",
            "Compared to semantic information, the essential characteristic of biased information is that s_biased does not have an invariant causal relationship with the subsequent text, which enables the disentanglement of biased information with semantic information. … Hence, if we can find the instances where the model obtains representations that are not invariant predictive, then the representations of these instances would contain biased information, which indicates that these instances are very likely to contain bias and could be identified as biased instances."
        ],
        "final_answer": "Because (a) manual discovery of the many and diverse dataset biases is impractical, and (b) causal invariance gives a principled way to disentangle semantic from spurious correlations, the authors integrate causal-invariance-based identification into active learning in order to automatically detect which instances are biased (one of the two core AL challenges) and thus enable an end-to-end, autonomous debiasing pipeline.",

In this task, the objective is to reconstruct the values of the masked intermediate temporal agent representations generated by AgentNet based on the values of the other vertices and the causal graph.",

Following the definition of the Granger causality for time series data in Section IV, the causal graph aids the prediction of future variables from the past value of its parents. Motivated by this we add the DAE task as an auxiliary supervision to facilitate the causal discovery. In this task, the objective is to reconstruct the values of the masked intermediate temporal agent representations generated by AgentNet based on the values of the other vertices and the causal graph. Note that, using temporal features for this task best matches the definition of Granger causality.",
            "Thereby, we employ a two-layer graph convolutional network (GCN) as a denoising autoencoder (DAE), where the graph is defined as: , the vertices are , where for computational efficiency we downsample and reshape the temporal agent representations, , where , and  is the downsampled temporal dimension. To avoid the model collapse to naïve solutions, we detach the gradients using the Stop Gradient operation denoted by SG so the DAE loss cannot directly affect representation learning in AgentNet.",

Subsequently, the GCN layers are defined as:  where  and  are the linear projection weight matrices, and  and  denote the intermediate vertex representations, and the reconstructed agent representations, respectively.

The reconstruction loss (negative cosine similarity) back-propagates through the GCN (with gradients stopped at AgentNet), encouraging the network to adjust the adjacency matrix so that it better captures the true Granger-causal dependencies among agents.",

This process is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the feature representations between the source and target domains in cross bienvenida.

This method, as outlined in the provided diagrams, enhances the model's ability to generalize well to novel target tasks, which is the core objective of the research. \n\nIn summary, the yellow box highlight is answering the [ледіgenerierung delen] - the device symbolizing the application of the prediction consistency priority and feature reconstruction priority C(pr) to analyst research subjects' networks. This model's capacity to train in a source domain and predict in a target domain is its ability to mitigate overfitting by applying sufficient regularization to the training data. The regularizers also learn domain-invariant representations that are exigences with the feature reconstruction priority in the meta-RNN. Consequently, the learning fully enables the network to generalize to new target (tasks) that are not in the training set while ensuring the effective predictions of the leading networks for the source bienvenida and the target. This meta-based regularization technique aims to address the meta-learning model's capabilities in eliminating overfitting to in-source meta-target if the underlying training data represented with limited support development data additions across distinct source and target tasks. glace rani 101909722\nThat is, the yellow box yellow box in diagrams highlight\tinput tensorflow onio constitute dimensions between taskframes liberté support.

            "Motivated by this perspective, we propose a prediction consistency prior and a feature reconstruction prior to jointly regularize the feature embedding network during meta-learning using high-low frequency information obtained from image decomposition.",
            "Specifically, the prediction consistency prior aims to minimize the separate Kullback-Leibler divergence between the prediction scores produced by the original query image and its each frequency component. The rationale behind this approach is twofold. Firstly, through explicit decomposition-alignment, we compel the model to attend to both low-frequency content and high-frequency structure. Secondly, establishing prediction consistency between high-low frequency and the original one is domain-invariant. This consistency aids the model in generalizing effectively across different domains.",
            "The feature reconstruction prior aims at reconstructing the original features utilizing low-frequency and high-frequency information in the latent space, which promotes the model to learn comprehensive representations."
        ],
        "final_answer": "By combining the two priors, the meta-learning procedure is simultaneously regularized at both the feature level and the prediction level. The feature reconstruction prior forces the network to fuse complementary low- and high-frequency embeddings into a complete, richly detailed representation, while the prediction consistency prior aligns the outputs of the original and decomposed inputs in a domain-invariant way. Together, they prevent over-fitting to source-domain priors and encourage the learning of cross-domain transferable features and predictions.",

In this work, we present an insightful meta-learning framework that exploits cross-domain invariant frequency priors to alleviate the over-fitting problems of classic meta-learning in cross-domain FSL tasks. Our method consists of an Image Decomposition Module (IDM) and a Prior Regularization Meta-Network (PRM-Net). Among them, IDM aim at explicitly decomposing every image in few-shot task into low- and high-frequency components. PRM-Net develops a prediction consistency prior and a feature reconstruction prior to jointly regularize the feature embedding network during meta-learning, aiming to learn generalizable image feature embeddings.

To dynamically bridge the gap between the pre-trained BERT model and the complex REC task, we introduce the Dynamic Prior Adapter, which operates in parallel with the text encoder, as shown in Figure 3. DyPA comprising four modules: a dynamic scale module (DS), a downward projection with parameters W_down, a ReLU activation layer, and an upward projection with parameters W_up.",
            "Specifically, we adopt the DS module for integrating the vision-aligned prior P to different layers in the BERT encoder. The module generates scale factors α using a scoring weight matrix W_s, eliminating manual hyper-parameter tuning. Given the prior P, the dynamic scaling factor can be formulated as follows:",
            "The downward projection and the upward projection are connected by a ReLU function. In one text encoder layer, the downward projection layer receives processed language tokens X from the Multi-head Attention (MHA) layer as input and produces adapter features.",

DyPA utilizes the vision-aligned prior P to dynamically regularize the feed-forward during adapter tuning. To mitigate the influence of adapter outputs during the initial stages of model training, we initialize α to zero."

        "final_answer": "The Dynamic Prior Adapter augments each BERT layer with a small adapter whose output is dynamically scaled by factors computed from the vision-aligned prior. Concretely, for each language block, the frozen CLIP–derived prior P is fed into a lightweight scoring weight matrix (the DS module) to produce a vector of scale factors α. In parallel with the feed-forward network, the adapter first down-projects the MHA output into a low-dimensional space, applies a ReLU nonlinearity, and then up-projects back to the hidden dimension. The resulting adapter features Δ are then multiplied element-wise by α and added into the residual stream of the feed-forward output. The scale factors α are initialized to zero so that early in training the adapter has no effect, and gradually learn to modulate each token’s contribution according to the vision-aligned prior.",

            "In this paper, we introduce a novel targeted adversarial example attack framework based on Salient region & Weighted Feature Drop (SWFD) for boosting the transferability. We first propose a weighted feature drop mechanism to prevent the adversarial example generation from becoming overly dependent on a narrow subset of features by diversifying the emphasis across a wider array of features, enhancing the transferability of these adversarial examples.",
            "Overfitting can occur when the perturbation generation overly emphasizes specific features, evident in the rough outputs of DNN deep layers (see Figure 1). To address this, we design the weighted feature drop (WFD) mechanism. WFD leverages the principle that adversarial examples with greater transferability typically yield smoother deep-layer outputs. Thus, enhancing transferability involves further smoothing these outputs, which is achieved by spreading focus across a wider feature set. Essentially, features with higher values are more likely to be dropped, alleviating the overfitting."
        ],
        "final_answer": "The weighted feature drop is applied to the layer-l feature map before computing the loss in order to smooth the deep-layer activations by randomly removing (dropping) those channels with the largest weights. This prevents the adversarial perturbation from overfitting to a small, high-importance subset of features in the surrogate model and, by diversifying the focus across a wider range of features, improves the transferability of the resulting adversarial example.",

Additionally, the implementation of high-quality selection during training is a crucial step in ensuring that the model learns from the most informative and relevant data points.",

After the projector alignment training, the model’s context length was progressively extended by incrementally increasing the context length from 4K, 32K, 128K, to 512K.",
            "During the training phase for contexts exceeding 128K in length, RingAttention (Liu et al., 2024b) is implemented for computing QKV attention. This specialized method is tailored for calculating attention over long contexts, addressing memory constraints associated with the quadratic complexity of attention weight computations. The fundamental concept involves segmenting QKV along the seq_len dimension into blocks of n*block_size, facilitating the iterative derivation of complete attention by calculating attention for each block."

Once contexts exceed 128K tokens, it switches from standard attention to RingAttention. RingAttention breaks the QKV tensors along the sequence dimension into manageable blocks (n×block_size) and computes full attention iteratively per block.

            "In contrast, both ORM and Math-Shepherd, which are trained using a binary supervision strategy, fail to show similar improvement. This underperformance could indicate the limitations inherent to binary supervision, especially in tasks that require complex reasoning. It is more prone to introducing noise into the binary supervision signal, which could consequently limit the verifier’s capabilities."

Although this grants more granular feedback across the reasoning chain, both process-supervised and outcome-supervised verifiers rely on binary classification and are similarly prone to noisy labels. As the experiments show, neither approach matches the performance of preference-based training, indicating that binary supervision (even when applied at the process level) remains limited for complex reasoning tasks.",

        "response": "unanswerable. The question \"What limitations arise from [łącz] within the [ evoc ] in capturing precise atomic positions?\" is not directly answerable based on the provided image and context. The image focuses on the structure, function, and applications of a protein language model called DPLM-2, rather than discussing specific limitations related to capturing precise atomic positions. The context provided does mention a limitation in the ability to learn robust representations due to limited structure data, but it does not detail a limitation related to the loss of precise atomic positions. Therefore, without additional specific information, the question remains unanswerable. The closest related components mentioned are \"structure data\" and \"trade-off of discrete latent representation,\" both of which pertain to the model's performance and the process of tokenizing structure data rather than the detailed atomic positioning.  In the context of protein modeling and data utilization, specific atomic positions are often not the primary focus, as the overall structural context, motifs, and interactions are more relevant. The limitations mentioned are more likely related to broader structural and representational challenges rather than the fine-grained precision of atomic positions.  Furthermore, the term \"precision\" in the context of atomic positions is not standard or commonly used in protein modeling or language models, indicating that this type of granularity may not even be within the capability or scope of these models. Therefore, the question as stated cannot be answered with the given information. The diagram and context provided do not explicitly address the tracking of precise atomic positions or associated limitations, making the question unanswerable in this case.  In conclusion, the specific details required to address the question are not present in the image or its accompanying text, leading to the conclusion that the question is unanswerable based on the provided context.

We use SAM to obtain the semantic mask  of the clothed human image  as the label and calculate the MSE loss  between  and  to optimize  of .

The [łączany] and [redir_th] mentioned in the original question (question 20210405) are not part of the diagram or related to the context provided. Therefore, the answer cannot be determined from the given information. The question is asking for a content comparison of a sample macro with its corresponding structural diagram, which is not present in the image. Hence, the answer is unanswerable.  Similar to the first, the question is also unanswerable because the diagram and the context provided in the image do not contain the reference to sample macro A. Therefore, the question is asking for a content comparison of A2 with its structural diagram in the quiz. Since A2 is not present in the image, there is no corresponding diagram to make a comparison. Thus, the answer is unanswerable. This is the same as in the first case as the answer is  failure .  The question is unanswerable because the image only contains the diagram, and the content compare instructions of its corresponding structural diagram for picture A2 cannot be provided.

            "However, when considering EEG, there are much more challenges to align EEG with text: 1) EEG signals contain complicated cognitive and non-cognitive information, which is hard to be described by human language accurately and thoroughly. For example, an EEG segment cannot only contain one person’s emotion and mental states, but also represent the body movement and medical normality. 2) The labeled EEG data available to construct EEG–text pair are very limited. Therefore, we propose to align EEG with text space-wise instead of embedding-wise.",
            "We introduce a domain classifier D to predict whether the embeddings are from EEG or text. During the codebook learning, we also feed some text embeddings from LLMs to train the domain classifier. A gradient reverse layer is added after the VQ encoder to confuse the domain classifier. Hence, the embeddings from the VQ encoder fall into the same space of text embeddings."

        "final_answer": "Because there are few or no high-quality EEG–text pairs and EEG signals carry complex semantics that are hard to label, the authors align EEG embeddings with text embeddings “space-wise” rather than one-to-one. They add a domain classifier that tries to distinguish EEG from text embeddings, and insert a gradient-reversal layer so that the VQ encoder is trained adversarially to produce embeddings the classifier cannot tell apart from text.

            "Earlier works in automatic assertion generation, such as AutoSVA [4] and ILA [5], have focused on creating a new abstraction level closer to human language. Although they succeeded in making the assertion generation process easier, they lost their generality and did not entirely solve the process, as engineers still had to develop new properties at these abstraction levels.",
            "We use three questions to extract meaningful comments from the specification. Listings 2, 3, and 4 outline the inquiries used to break the specification into smaller components. The first question in Listing 2 is directed at FSMs in the design. For every FSM, we extract the states and the conditions to transfer from one state to another. This helps to break each FSM into multiple assertions, each indicating one transition between the states. Question C in Listing 4 was tailored to extract the variable ranges. Each of these pieces of information was then treated as one assertion in the remainder of the flow."

        "final_answer": "Instead of relying on a single, coarse abstraction layer into which an entire specification must be mapped, AssertCraft uses separate LLMs—one to extract each FSM’s individual state transitions (LLM for FSM Extraction) and another to extract each variable’s valid ranges (LLM for variable Extraction). By turning each transition and each variable‐range constraint into its own comment, the tool generates far more fine-grained, modular comments. These detailed comments then feed into the assertion generator, avoiding the broad, less-specific properties that abstraction-level approaches leave for engineers to refine by hand.",

Hence, we propose to generate a dynamic prompt conditioned on each test sample.",

Otherwise, if the sub-model exceeds the device’s memory capacity, the memory-exhausted device is removed from the set.

            "Some prior approaches (e.g., MB-GMN(Xia et al., 2021 ###reference_b29###), MB-GCN(Jin et al., 2020 ###reference_b11###), and DMT(Gu et al., 2020 ###reference_b7###)) involve initially aggregating items within each behavior to obtain a cohesive representation, followed by modeling dependencies across all behaviors using attention or weighted summation operations. These approaches model the multi-behavior dependency between interactions with same behavior type, which we called behavior-level dependency (e.g., blue arrow). Recently, MB-STR(Yuan et al., 2022 ###reference_b35###) proposed multi-behavior multi-head self-attention to model multi-behavior dependency between interactions with same item, which we called item-level dependency (e.g., green arrow). Nevertheless, multi-behavior dependency between interactions with inconsistent behavior types and items is significant as well, which we defined as interaction-level dependency (e.g., red arrow).",
            "To learn interaction-level multi-behavior dependency, we introduce the incidence matrix A taking both item-level and behavior-level semantics into consideration. To achieve this goal, we calculate each entry a_{i,j} as following, where e^I are item semantic embedding representations and e^B are behavior semantic embedding representations. First, we operate dot product on item-specific pair and behavior-specific pair to get A^I and A^B respectively, which learns the multi-behavior dependency from item-level and behavior-level perspectives synchronously. To learn item- and behavior-level dependency in an integrated manner, an inner product is performed on item-level dependency representation and behavior-level dependency representation."
        ],
        "final_answer": "By jointly computing a dependency score for each pair of interactions as the inner product of both their item-level and behavior-level similarity scores, the model builds an incidence matrix that captures ‘‘synchronous’’ multi-behavior signals. This integrated representation feeds into graph convolution to propagate and refine dependencies across interactions. In contrast, attention-only methods either merge behaviors first or attend only within one semantic view, missing the richer, cross-semantic interaction-level patterns that the combined inner-product approach uncovers.",

Can it be applied to other types of data?\nCould you provide some practical examples of feature extraction used in various industries or applications? \nHow could the feature extraction process you described be simulated or demoed in a practical scenario? \nThe original answer is complete, is this correct version different? \n\n## Your explanation \n\nBased upon the context provided, the term \"feature extraction\" is a computational process within applications of touchless technology for learning languages used in instructional media.\n\nTo provide an overview, this process involves identifying the most relevant or important characteristics in a given dataset or signal. These characteristics or features can include elements such as lighting conditions, éagssizeof squarts produced, or even some other color orOUGH attributes. This information is extracted because of potential advantages measured in comparison to signals of other searches, tests, or voller factors. Doing so can improve many design, algorithmic, design, or potential impact roles, simple or cumulated.\n\nThis process indeed involves the use of machine learning or artificial intelligence algorithms. There are several types of algorithms that can be employed for feature extraction depending on the type of data being processed, such as image data or otherwise. These algorithms can use different techniques such as statistical analysis, pattern matching, or the mechanisms of deep learning. Their ultimate goal is to ensure that the signal or sound includes the most useful or relevant information to the question at hand.\n\nThe processes depicted in the diagram are certainly related to feature extraction, analyzing them and breaking them down toಣದಲ್ಲಿ possible steps to simulate using a pen work or learning aid. These steps can show how sound travels in different environments, how interactions get abandon de related to certain sensors, different shades of light and light work along several different steps. This simulation includes recommendations variables through human understanding and appropriately converting to the correct AI output delusions aboundsheadh sum coluna using aизи diagram tool more elek calibration.\n\nOh, Feature extraction is not only applicable to Image data, but other types of data could be used as well. In practice, there is a range of different types of data extracted for many different potential purposes. For example, audio files can be transformed into matrices that give a representation of frequency and amplitude over time. Sensor readings taken in a machine sense system can be parsed for insights on performance that are similar to mathematical analysis that may not visually appear pictorial.\n\nPractical examples of feature extraction used in various industries or applications include analyzing satellite imagery for weather patterns, benefício, identifying objects within manufacturing for potential defects, tracking motion data for academic research projects, person recognition inside software algorithms, and even some strategies used in speech recognition for translation/"

By modeling causation-sensitive (asymmetric) relations, the system better reflects how one item actually influences the inclusion of another, improving the accuracy of bundle recommendations.",

However, in this case, the text requiring a response is not present or implied in the provided caption and context. The diagram instead shows a flowchart of the workflow and components used in DreamMix for subject-driven image in continuam, without elaborating on specifics pertaining to a particular attribute or its decoupling within text or image data. As such, it is unanswerable due to the lack of detail in the provided context pointing towards a specific attribute. The task is to use the diagram to deduce or infer information about successful subject-driven image inicionado, but the diagram itself does not provide a clear image of a particular attribute or how it would be decoupled. Therefore, deducing the specific content of any masked or highlighted area is not feasible. The answer is that the diagram lacks the necessary detail for that purpose. The overall text thus remains unanswerable. The reasoning thus proceeds after reading Diagram Ietl 1's caption and attempting to match it against the question provided. The analysis is to go through the logical flow implied by the diagram's complexity and the elements involved in producing DreamMix to identify the missing detail.

            "Existing subject-driven inpainting methods [39, 6, 26] usually build on pretrained diffusion models, wherein the lowest resolution of latent features is 32 times smaller than the original input images. This substantial reduction in resolution hinders these methods’ ability to effectively inpaint objects in very confined local regions.",

            "Holistic scene context plays a pivotal role for precisely inferring the state of each voxel. However, learning over 3-D volumes is neither computationally feasible (the large number of voxels is not amenable to intensive convolutions or attention-based operations) nor necessary (most voxels are void and should not been involved in the computation).",
            "Computation over the entire 3-D scene volume is computationally forbidden for large scenes. To avoid it, we devise a scheme of multi-group triplanar projection for holistic / local scene context extraction in cluttered scenes.",
            "Importantly, the above process of triplanar projection is lossy, thus we further propose to use multiple groups of tri-planes that differ in 3-D rotations and share the same origin, thereby more key information can be preserved via diverse aggregations.",
            "The utilization of multi-group tri-plane approximately captures global scene context in a concise way. On the one hand, more aggregation groups improve the possibility of restoring features for the occluded parts and enriches the 3-D shape clues during projection. On the other hand, it significantly reduces the data size during calculation and avoids the direct operation on dense 3D volume features."
        ],
        "final_answer": "Directly operating on full 3D volumes is too expensive and unnecessary, and a single triplanar projection loses information. By deploying multiple groups of tri-planes—each rotated differently in SO(3)—the method preserves more of the scene’s global structure, enriches shape clues for occluded parts, and drastically reduces data size and computation compared to dense volumetric operations.",

        "response": "For the question at hand, I would need to compare the generated queries in a structured manner and then conduct a comprehensive analysis of the content and any reference visuals provided to arrive at the correct answer, utilizing reasoning and chain-of-thought processes as depicted. However, without further clarifications or a specific user query format, the detailed task here would be expansive and comprehensive. To condense the process into terms, Mask 1 is the content highlighted by the red box in the image, which refers to Motion Event Loss, whereas Mask 2 is highlighted by the blue box, pertaining to the simulated event stream. Examples that might capture what this question could involve:\n\n[value_1]: Motion Event Loss\n[value_2]: Simulated Event Stream\n\nThat being said, to proceed with the task, it is crucial to have a structured query in various formats such as benefício, string, chain of thought, diagram, etc. So first, I will perform image-text alignment.\n\nFollow by a reasoning process and analysis based on the content displayed in both the diagram and the corresponding text of the research paper.\n...\n\nFor the purpose of this task, no question has been provided for me to answer. Please provide a specific and meaningful question to help me generate a valuable answer. (The question could be a structured question like eut or the instruction stem of a JFQ in this case) \n\nAdditionally, without further context or the aim to compare or contrast different elements or themes from the image, the question and steps you provide would be redundant. Moreover, accuracy and-chain-of-thought verification can only occur if there is some reference to be compared or truth to validate that chain-of-thought process. And as mentioned earlier, without a specific user query, the entire task of reasoning and verification can't be effectively carried out. For me to generate a response, a well-defined query and reasoning process are essential. To hone in on the valid question cartera, an efficient chain-of-thought process can be formulated and effectively directed. Unfortunately, without a suitable reference, it is impossible to provide the required context update necessary to invalidate or invalidate a path of reasoning. This process exemplifies a well-structured approach, but without executing within the precise paradigm of a contextual framework, the intended outcome becomes unachievable. The rigorous necessity of a structured inquiry and an algorithmic pursuit to translate a question into a series of comprehensive yet plausibly concluded steps is rendered moot in application here.

            "Specifically, we model the human ratings of an instance x as a multi-dimensional Gaussian distribution P in the space, which is used as a feature for pairwise comparisons, as shown in the right of Fig. 3.",
            "Firstly, we build up a Gaussian distribution in the high-dimensional psychological scale space according to the human ratings. Then, we randomly sample from these Gaussian distributions for pairwise comparisons. This process can be considered as disturbing a single feature point on the latent space, which is the feature level augmentation.",
            "Afterwards, we apply T times Monte Carlo sampling on the distribution of instance x_i, which is analogous to the observations of multiple subjects on a stimulus.",
            "The comparator C in conventional order learning is applied to learn the order between two sampling feature points. The relative relation R(P_i,P_j) between two distributions of P_i and P_j is obtained by calculating the mean of C comparisons."
        ],
        "final_answer": "By modeling each instance’s features as a Gaussian distribution and then drawing multiple Monte Carlo samples from these distributions, the comparator evaluates many perturbed feature realizations rather than a single fixed point. Averaging the comparator’s outputs over all sampled pairs incorporates the uncertainty in human ratings, reduces sensitivity to noise or outliers, and yields more stable, reliable order relations in the order learning module.",

This yields two separate, fixed-length prefix vectors—one capturing context–personality interactions and the other context–empathy interactions—which are then concatenated (along with prefixes derived from past responses and empathy signals) to form a multi-grained prefix for the decoder.",

Specifically, we define a set of keypoint rescaling operations, including modifying the length of the body, legs, arms, neck, and shoulders, altering face size, even adding or removing specific body parts and etc. These transformations are stored in a rescale pool. After obtaining the realigned poses, we apply a random selection of transformations from this pool with a certain probability on them, generating the final transformed poses.",
            "We further conduct more detailed ablation experiments for different pairs of pose transformations by (1) removing the entire EPI: w/o EPI. (2) removing Pose Rescale: w/o Rescale; (3) remove Pose Realignment: w/o Realignment; From the results displayed in Tab. 4, we found that Pose Realignment contributes the most.

            "Second, existing AI-powered tools support only either single-turn or linear interactions with AI models, and therefore do not accommodate branching and backtracking that commonly occur in the iterative authoring process. When non-linear contexts are merged into a linear history, it is not only challenging for users to communicate which designs should be used towards next iterations, but also challenging for AI model to correctly retrieve relevant content from the long conversation history (Liu et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2023; Hsieh et al., 2024).",
            "Data Formulator 2 introduces data threads to represent the tree-structured iteration history to support navigation tasks. Centering the iteration history around data benefits user navigation because it directly reflects the sequence of user actions in creating these new data. This design also benefits the AI model: when a user issues a follow-up instruction, Data Formulator 2 automatically retrieves its conversation history with the AI towards the current data and then instructs the AI model to rewrite the code towards new goals based on the retrieved history. This way, the AI model does not pose risk of incorrectly using conversation history from other branches to make incorrect data transformation."
        ],
        "final_answer": "Iterative visualization authoring commonly involves branching and backtracking, which linear conversation logs cannot adequately represent. Merging non-linear branches into a single linear history makes it difficult for users to pick the correct prior design to build on and for the AI to identify the relevant context. By organizing history as Data Threads—tree-structured, data-centered records—users can navigate and fork past states directly, and the AI can retrieve only the branch-specific history, avoiding cross-branch confusion and ensuring correct follow-up transformations.",

            "Instead of directly adopting SDF-based reconstruction methods to extract 3D mesh, we first use the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) algorithm (Kerbl et al., 2023) to learn an implicit 3D model from the generated high-resolution image sequence. 3DGS has demonstrated remarkable novel view synthesis capabilities and impressive rendering speed. Herein we attempt to utilize 3DGS’s implicit reconstruction ability to augment the output sparse multi-view images of Stage-2 with more novel views.",
            "Specifically, we render interpolation views between the adjacent images in U from the reconstructed 3DGS. Finally, we optimize an SDF-based reconstruction method (Wang et al., 2021a) based on the augmented dense views U∪ to extract the high-quality 3D mesh of the object."

        "final_answer": "3D Gaussian Splatting first builds an implicit 3D representation from the sparse high-resolution views and then rapidly renders many intermediate (interpolated) viewpoints, turning a sparse set of images into a dense multi-view sequence. Feeding these densely synthesized views into a standard SDF-based mesh extractor overcomes the brittleness of purely implicit surface methods on sparse data, leading to more stable optimization and higher-fidelity mesh reconstructions.",

The inference process occurs at inference time only, for inference output.  So the inference of the view selects the latent set fitbitin output.  Usually, this does not happen during the training.

            "Difficulty Score Calculation. Referring to [55], if the student network can correctly classify a sample, we infer it is an easy sample, and vice versa for a hard sample. Technically, the cross-entropy loss of a sample indicates how much its prediction is similar to its label, and it can be regarded as the sample difficulty. Accordingly, we define the difficulty score γ_i of sample i as follows: γ_i = L_CE(x_i) / (1/|B| Σ_{x_j in B} L_CE(x_j)).",
            "Learning Weight of the Sample. In the context of our preview-based learning strategy, we make the student not only concentrate on the easy samples but also preview the hard samples. In other words, in one batch of the training, preview-based learning strategy pays more attention to making the student correctly classify the easy samples while less attention to the hard samples. To fulfill this, we introduce an auxiliary weight v_i to each sample as its attention during the training as follows: v_i = {1, if γ_i < τ; τ/γ_i, otherwise}.",
            "Since the learning weight v is designed to control the attention of the student to classify samples correctly, we only add it into the losses that are utilized for the classification, i.e., L_CE and L_KD."

        "final_answer": "The Preview-based Learning Strategy first computes a per-sample difficulty score γ_i from the sample’s cross-entropy loss normalized by the batch mean. It then converts γ_i into a learning weight v_i (with v_i = 1 for easy samples and v_i < 1 for hard samples). During training, this weight v_i is used to scale both the student’s cross-entropy loss (L_CE) and the knowledge distillation loss (L_KD) on a per-sample basis, thus down-weighting hard samples early on and progressively including them as training proceeds.",

Since CRIME is mentioned in the document but not highlighted by a red box, there seems to be a mistake in the image. The red box and the content of the text should correspond to the same section or item. If a red box highlights a specific part of the text, it should be on the same side of the diagram, which is not the case with what is shown. Hence, it is not possible to provide a clear response to the question as stated. Additionally, since the rest of the diagram is not fully visible, and there is no visible red box or content that matches the reference, it is not possible to answer the question accurately. To provide a meaningful answer, the specific part of the diagram that corresponds to [łącz1] must be highlighted or provided as part of the image. It seems that the actual content of [леді北京赛车pk导] requires analysis of a part of Diagram B that is represented in the image description but not shown within the provided figure.

Let x be the input feature map from SD, then the feature map y from the ControlNet is defined as y=SN(x;θ′)+ΔCN(x, c;θ), where ΔCN denotes x zero-convolution layers with trainable parameters that link pre-trained SD with ControlNet blocks and c is the conditioning signal.

Stage-1111 involves training the SD inpainting model using the real images and masks for each organ separately. In stage-2222, pre-trained ControlNet is plugged into the SSI model (SSI-CN) to precisely generate each anatomical structure using extracted edges from the segmentation mask. The image composition in stage-3333 includes cutting out each organ from the generated image and combining them together to form the multi-class surgical dataset. Stage-4444 (optional) includes an image refinement process using SDEdit [36] to rectify inconsistencies during the composition operation and generate the multi-class images. We skip stage-1111 for the simulated masks and start directly with the inference stages to generate the synthetic datasets.",

Specifically, it employs the reverse process of denoising, where to maintain control of the generated content, they use:\nan SD model tonos oall the organs combined with SDEdit to refine the generated images, add or modify layers during the process, or change the typical diffusion strategy to encourage the modeling of realistic datasets, also adjust the standard diffusion process or overall parameters.  This effectively allows the team to generate more detailed outputs. Thus, the initial noise-based editing strategies used in the diffusion models effectively serve as noise-aligned approaches used in the later multi-class data generation. One way to use pre isotop é credit largely depends on creating a suitable control network to generate needed mutation  images that the SDEdit does not focus on.

Top: This figure categorizes safety threats for drones, including attacks on humans, objects, infrastructure, and FAA regulations, highlighting the process by which an LLM-controlled drone could be used to carry out physical harm and damage. Mid: Flowchart illustrating the benchmark process for drone control. Given a specific LLM, the evaluation process involves providing a test prompt and categorizing the output based on whether code is included in the response. The output is then assessed by two AI judges. The code is further tested in a simulation environment to detect potential collision risks, contributing to the final safety evaluation for the model. Bottom left: Composition of the benchmark’s evaluation datasets, which are primarily categorized into four main types: deliberate attacks, unintentional attacks, violation attacks, and utility. These categories help assess the model’s performance from different perspectives. Bottom right: Safety evaluation results obtained using different LLMs. It is observed that LLMs with higher scores in utility and code fidelity (indicating better control over the drone using code) tend to show higher safety risks than others. The safety metrics are formally defined in Materials and Methods. Please refer to the supplementary file for the video demo.",

            "Joint Tokens. The transformer decoder aims to map high-level spatiotemporal features F_s from the encoder to instance-level temporal features F_t. To enable the network to learn human body correspondence across frames, the Transformer decoder incorporates joint tokens t_i to regress the joint position of each frame. With the spatiotemporal features F_s and joint tokens t_i, the transformer decoder produces joint features \\hat{t}_i and temporal features F_t using self-attention and cross-attention blocks.",
            "In Sec. III-C, joint tokens are introduced to guide the temporal transformer in capturing correspondences between frames and extracting temporal features. To demonstrate the role of joint tokens, we also evaluated the spatial temporal transformer without joint tokens (w/o J-Tokens). Compared with the third row in Table IV (w/o T-Trans), the temporal features extracted by the spatial temporal transformer without joint tokens have a negative impact on the reconstruction quality. This indicates that Joint Tokens play a crucial role in ensuring that the spatial temporal transformer accurately extracts temporal features."
        ],
        "final_answer": "During decoding, joint tokens act as learned queries representing body-joint positions. By injecting these tokens into the transformer decoder alongside the encoder’s spatiotemporal features, the model uses self- and cross-attention to align features across frames based on joint correspondences. This guidance ensures that the temporal features it produces are correctly synchronized to the human pose dynamics, improving reconstruction quality in ambiguous regions.",

Different procedures are employed for visible (orange box) and invisible (green box) point, with the primary distinction lying in the normal map prediction module. Two S-Trans with identical structures are employed to separately predict the front and back maps. The front-normal S-Trans uses the image as input, while the back-normal S-Trans utilizes the front normal map. The T-Trans utilizes the same module across both prediction processes. The Joint Tokens are employed to guide the correspondence between adjacent frames in network learning. The output joint positions serve as a supervisory signal for the network. In addition, to enhance the network’s learning in ambiguous areas, we introduced random mask during the training process in the second stage. Finally, the input of the implicit function consists of 2D features (Normal map), 3D features (SDF), and temporal features (T-Trans).",

These specialists provide supervisory signals to Omni-Edit.",

The [mask2] refers to the content highlighted by a blue box in the image. The vertical structure is described as performing the best in the risk analysis task among the different agent collaboration structures examined in the study. This is expected because risk analysis is a complex task requiring the AI agents to not only collect and organize a variety of information but also to execute an in-depth analysis of such information. Here, an in-depth analysis implies that different agents may haveecake different opinions. For this kind of task, we need a core leader to synthesize the analysis results of different analysts and make the final risk judgment. This ability to integrate different perspectives and make a final decision is facilitated under the vertical structure. Thus, the vertical structure among multi-agent stipend should perform better according to the performance of different AI agent structures on risk analysis task. If the question is completely unanswerable based on the context, simply respond with \"unanswerable.\" The [mask1] refers to the content highlighted by a red box in the image. In two instances in the text, the red box highlights the RAG database. A preprocessed RAG database consists of tools function that access to SECEquipo’s database (AARP, Carhart, andبرتYoungCapital_Management, 2022) and the SECEquipo database. The database and the function allow the financial analyst to generate the relevant chunk text in a continuous and continuous manner. This tool function allows a perfect instrument for an analyst to retrieve relevant pieces of information from the annual report, which should be very long and complex.

        "final_answer": "Instead of relying on text-prompted vision-language models (e.g. GLIP) for part supervision, SAMPart3D uses the self-supervised DINOv2 backbone to provide low-level, text-independent features. These DINOv2 features are upsampled via FeatUp to produce high-resolution, point-wise targets. Multi-view renderings are used to map 2D DINOv2 features onto 3D points (handling occlusions via depth), and the averaged features across views serve as supervision in an MSE loss to train the PTv3-object backbone. This reshapes standard 2D-to-3D distillation by removing the need for text prompts, improving feature granularity, and enabling scalable learning from large unlabeled 3D datasets.",

        "relevant_context": [
            "The noise type in the previous denoising framework was restricted to set as coordinate Gaussian noise (CGN) with isotropic noise variance, to maintain the force learning interpretation. However, the use of isotropic CGN noise leads to a biased molecular distribution, focusing on isotropic vibrations around equilibrium positions, since molecules exhibit not only small-scale vibrations but also rotation along rotatable single bonds on a relatively large scale, as illustrated in Figure 1a. Modeling this biased molecular distribution leads to inaccuracies in force targets and constraining the sampling range around equilibriums, as indicated by our theoretical analysis in Supplementary Information A.1, and ultimately hinders the model’s performance on downstream tasks.",
            "Given the difficulty in modeling the true molecular distribution, we choose to characterize the distribution more comprehensively by introducing chemical priors about molecular distribution into noise design, which is prohibited in previous methods due to the restricted noise distribution.",
            "Therefore, we propose a novel molecular pre-training framework called fractional denoising (Frad), which is proven to hold the force learning interpretation. Specifically, given an equilibrium molecular conformation, a hybrid noise of chemical-aware noise (CAN) and CGN is added and a noisy conformation is obtained, the model is trained to predict CGN from the noisy conformation. The term “fractional” refers to recovering a fraction of the entire noise introduced, with the necessity of the design discussed in Supplementary Information A.2. Notably, CAN is customizable enabling Frad to incorporate chemical priors to optimize molecular distribution modeling.",
            "Inspired by the chemical priors that describe molecular conformational changes, we present two versions of CAN. Specifically, rotation noise (RN) is advocated to capture rotations of single bonds, while vibration and rotation noise (VRN) is put forward to reflect anisotropic vibrations."
        ],
        "final_answer": "Whereas prior coordinate-denoising methods perturb an equilibrium structure solely with isotropic coordinate Gaussian noise (CGN), Frad first adds a chemical-aware noise (CAN) component—e.g. bond‐rotation and anisotropic vibration perturbations—and then layers on CGN. The model is trained to recover only the CGN “fraction” of that hybrid noise. In this way, CAN expands the sampling beyond small, isotropic displacements and CGN remains an adjustable residual to preserve the force‐learning interpretation.",

            "Given an equilibrium molecular conformation, a hybrid of chemical-aware noise (CAN) and coordinate Gaussian noise (CGN) are added, where the equilibrium conformation refers to the structure at local minima of the potential energy surface of the molecule. Then the model is trained to predict CGN from the noisy conformation, namely fractional denoising, as it recovers a portion of the introduced noise.",
            "Notably, our theoretical analysis reveals that the task, irrespective of the distribution of CAN, possesses a force learning interpretation, whereas the CAN distribution affects the force targets and sampling distribution.",
            "As an immediate consequence, a corollary arises: the score function of the conformation distribution equals the molecular forces up to a constant factor, i.e. ∇_x log p(x) ∝ –∇_x E(x), where E(x) is the potential energy and ∇_x E(x) the atomic forces.",
            "If the distribution of hybrid noise satisfies Δx is a coordinate Gaussian noise (CGN), then fractional denoising is equivalent to learning the atomic forces that correspond to the approximate molecular distribution by Boltzmann Distribution."
        ],
        "final_answer": "By first perturbing an equilibrium conformation with two kinds of noise—CAN to span realistic rotations and vibrations around the minimum, and CGN to provide a formal Gaussian coordinate disturbance—Frad trains a network to predict only the CGN component (fractional denoising).  When Δx is Gaussian, the optimal denoising function recovers the score ∇_x log p(x) of the noisy‐sample distribution, which under Boltzmann statistics equals the negative energy gradient (i.e. atomic forces) up to a constant.  The CAN part merely shapes the sampling distribution and force targets, while the CGN term underpins the exact equivalence to force learning.",

The directed edge set signifies supply chain connections between companies, while the undirected edge set denotes mutual competitor relationships. Notably, our knowledge graph lacks numerous competitor edges, resulting in a significantly smaller volume for compared to. Our objective is to leverage the limited competitor edges, combined with the extensive company node attributes and supply chain graph structure, to identify additional competitors for a given company.",
            "Although competitor edges are sparse in our graph, learning from these connections is natural and essential. We employ first-order proximity to characterize the local connection and use it as supervised information that constrains the similarity of latent representations between pairs of competitors ... Finally, we utilized a pairwise ranking loss function (Equation 3) to minimize the distance between positive pairs and simultaneously maximizing the distance between negative pairs ...",
            "The loss function for the second order proximity is to minimize the difference between the original node feature vectors and the reconstructed ones, which can be formulated as Equation 6 ... The ultimate objective function of our model integrates the loss function derived from both the first-order and second-order proximity, and can be mathematically represented as Equation 7. where λ is a hyper parameter to balance the first-order and second-order losses, r is the regularization term."

        "final_answer": "Because the model must simultaneously capture (1) the sparse but highly informative competitor relationships via the Laplacian Eigenmap (first‐order proximity) and (2) the broader supply‐chain structure and node‐attribute information via reconstruction of X_i (second‐order proximity), it uses a single joint objective with a hyperparameter λ to trade off and balance these two loss terms. Balancing ensures the learned embeddings reflect both competitor connections and feature/supply‐chain structure rather than over‐fitting to one source of information.",

If the model objective requires balancing the [re HOURS] and Re HOURS losses in the objective function, this is good for the quality of the entity boundary.

Then the text goes on to describe that these devices are often included in bundles to fit the needs of individual users or that they need to be tested in such a range of devices up the networks because of that there should be some tutorials that one could find also following the fundamentals. Of course, if the person who has a problem with those devices is through the links below, then they can be triggered to get rid of the device and also try to avoid the same problem again in potions that have damaged before. Most importantly, these barcodes can also be played and tracked through systems that keep lives as well such barcodes.
