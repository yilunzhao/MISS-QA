        "response": "Let's break down the question carefully:\n\n**Question:**  \nWhat advantage does coupling the [mask1] with [mask2] confer on denoising quality?  \n- [mask1] = content in the red box in the image = **Conditional Discriminator**  \n- [mask2] = content in the blue box in the image = **Transformer Encoders (part of Conditional Gesture Generator)**\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify these components in the context and their roles\n\n- **Conditional Discriminator (red box)**:  \n  From the text: The conditional discriminator is part of a conditional GAN structure that discriminates whether the given samples are real or fake based on the conditional controls (time step t, audio signals, seed gestures). Its training objective is to implicitly match the joint distribution between noisy and denoised gestures at different steps. This enables the model to model complex denoising distributions, beyond simple Gaussian assumptions.\n\n- **Transformer Encoders (blue box inside the generator)**:  \n  This is the generator's core denoising network, which takes noisy input at step t plus conditional embeddings (audio features, style, seed gesture) and noise latent z and predicts the clean gesture sequence (denoising). Transformer encoders use attention mechanisms to better capture long-range temporal dependencies and asynchrony between audio and gesture sequences. \n\n---\n\n### Step 2: What does the text say about coupling these two modules?\n\n- Section on **Implicit Joint Distribution Matching** explains the GAN-based approach where the conditional discriminator and conditional generator jointly work to model the complex denoising distribution. The discriminator provides an adversarial supervisory signal to help the generator learn to predict denoised gestures that fool the discriminator, encouraging better fidelity, diversity, and quality.\n\n- The text contrasts this with prior methods that rely purely on Gaussian noise assumptions and small step noise, which fail when step size is increased to accelerate sampling.\n\n- The generator alone (with transformer encoders) can predict clean gestures from noisy inputs, but coupling it with an adversarial discriminator conditions the generator via adversarial loss to learn **more complex multi-step denoising distributions** that better capture real gesture statistics.\n\n- The **discriminator conditions on time step t and control signals** to match the joint distributions at multiple diffusion steps, enabling modeling of multimodal and complex distributions beyond the unimodal Gaussian assumption.\n\n- The collaboration leads to the possibility of speeding up sampling by using **larger step sizes and fewer steps** while maintaining or improving denoising quality.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Why does this coupling improve denoising quality?\n\n- The **discriminator helps the generator learn richer gesture distributions** by adversarially enforcing realism in generated samples, which cannot be fully captured by simple reconstruction (e.g., L2 loss) alone.\n\n- The **transformer encoders provide strong sequence modeling** capability for the generator to reconstruct plausible gestures conditioned on audio and style.\n\n- The **adversarial training helps capture multimodal distributions and complex noise patterns** introduced by larger step noise between diffusion steps—something the transformer alone, trained only with reconstruction loss, might not fully exploit.\n\n- This combination addresses limitations of previous diffusion acceleration methods that suffered from artifacts or degraded quality due to assumptions of simple Gaussian noise and small step sizes.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Final synthesis\n\nCoupling the **Conditional Discriminator** (red box) with the **Transformer-based Generator** (blue box) enables implicit joint distribution matching between noisy and clean gestures at varying diffusion steps. This adversarial learning strategy allows the model to:\n\n- Capture complex, possibly multimodal denoising distributions beyond simple Gaussian assumptions.\n\n- Effectively model noise distributions with large step sizes, accelerating sampling steps.\n\n- Improve denoising quality by enforcing realistic motion patterns that respect audio control signals and temporal coherence via the transformer architecture.\n\n- Overcome oversimplified reconstruction losses and avoid artifacts, enhancing gesture fidelity and stability.\n\n---\n\n### **Answer:**\n\nCoupling the **Conditional Discriminator** (red box) with the **Transformer Encoders** in the generator (blue box) confers the advantage of modeling complex, multimodal denoising distributions through implicit joint distribution matching. This adversarial setup enables the generator to learn to denoise effectively with larger step sizes and fewer steps by capturing more realistic and diverse gesture dynamics conditioned on audio and style. The discriminator guides the generator to produce high-fidelity, natural gestures by distinguishing real from fake samples within the denoising process, while the transformer encoders provide strong temporal modeling to reconstruct plausible sequences. Together, they improve denoising quality beyond the limitations of traditional Gaussian noise assumptions and simple reconstruction losses, enabling fast and high-quality gesture generation."

The transformer outputs more complex posterior parameters.\n   - **Separating Deterministic Encoding and Stochastic Sampling:** Having the transformer encode all the conditional information and produce a posterior distribution allows for a modular separation—first compute distribution parameters, then sample.\n   - **Enables Efficient Training and Inference:** Posterior Sampling after Transformer output allows the model to explicitly model the reverse step uncertainty, enabling fewer denoising steps but still producing realistic and diverse gesture samples.\n   - By sampling from the posterior after transformer encoding, the model can maintain the stochastic nature of the diffusion process while leveraging the powerful representation capabilities of the transformer to encode complex dependencies.\n\n### Summary:\n\n**The motivation for placing the \"Posterior Sampling\" step after the Transformer Encoders in the generator pipeline is to leverage the transformer's powerful conditional encoding of noisy input and control signals to parameterize a complex, multimodal posterior distribution of the clean gesture representation. Posterior Sampling then performs stochastic sampling from this learned distribution, enabling the model to handle large diffusion steps and fewer steps while maintaining high-quality, diverse gesture generation. This separation facilitates modeling the reverse diffusion's inherent stochasticity and supports efficient generation by explicitly capturing the distribution from which the next step's clean data sample is drawn.**"

Architecture Search for New Tasks\n\n- In the design principle learning stage, **a set of well-performing architectures is collected**, and then  \n  **a prompt is devised to help a pre-trained LLM reason general design principles from these architectures**.  \n\n- Due to token limits, feeding whole source codes of all architectures directly is not feasible.\n\n- To tackle this, the approach is to **design prompts consisting of Python class templates that instantiate architectures parametrically** (as shown in the red box).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: How the red box helps engage chain-of-thought reasoning\n\n- The prompt in the red box provides a compact and parameterized representation of architectures as Python classes. This lets the LLM understand the architecture in a structured way rather than parsing whole source code files.\n\n- The context states the LLM is then instructed to reason general design principles **using a chain-of-thought (CoT) approach**, with these steps:\n\n  1.

Without reasonable depth assumptions, the projection would be highly inaccurate.\n- Once the projection is defined based on this ground-aware depth assumption, there will still be **residual errors** in reprojecting the views from the real cameras into the virtual camera coordinate system.\n- The **Minimizing Projection Error** strategy (mask2) **refines the virtual camera configurations** by iteratively optimizing their parameters to reduce these reprojection errors.\n- Thus, **mask1 provides the geometric assumptions that enable initial projection and depth estimation**, while **mask2 systematically optimizes the virtual camera parameters to minimize the discrepancies between the real camera projections and the virtual camera mappings**.\n- Together, this interplay ensures the unified virtual camera views are **both geometrically grounded with depth assumptions and statistically optimized for minimal reprojection errors**, improving the accuracy and consistency of virtual view transformations across multiple different camera configurations.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe **Ground-aware Depth Assumption** provides a principled method to estimate the 3D position of pixels in the virtual camera views by assuming points lie on the ground plane or a cylindrical surface, enabling initial projection from real camera views to a unified virtual space. This estimation forms the geometric foundation for mapping pixels across views. The **Minimizing Projection Error** strategy then iteratively optimizes the virtual camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters using a heuristic search (CMA-ES) to reduce the angular reprojection errors between the original and virtual camera projections. Together, these two strategies interplay by first defining a depth-informed projection framework and then refining the virtual camera setup to minimize projection discrepancies, leading to more accurate and transferable virtual view transformations across varying multi-camera driving systems."

These AFR modules refine the extracted features before they are passed into the \"Riemannian Geometry Projection\" blocks.\n\n2. **Purpose of AFR:**  \n   From the context, the Adaptive Feature Refiner modules are designed to fine-tune features of their respective modalities—text and point cloud—and map them into a common feature space suitable for subsequent similarity computations, specifically Riemann Attention.\n\n3. **Architecture of AFR:**  \n   Each AFR consists of a stack of six Self-Attention Encoders derived from the Transformer encoder architecture (Vaswani et al. 2017).  \n   \n   - Each Self-Attention Encoder layer contains two main sub-layers:\n     - A Multi-Head Self-Attention (MSA) sub-layer  \n     - A Feed-Forward Network (FFN) sub-layer  \n   - Both sub-layers are wrapped with residual connections (\"Add\") and layer normalization (\"Norm\"), often summarized as \"Add & Norm.\"\n\n4. **Combination of Self-Attention and FFN:**  \n   - The MSA sub-layer uses scaled dot-product attention to allow each token to attend to all other tokens in the sequence, capturing contextual relationships.  \n   - The FFN sub-layer consists of two nonlinear fully connected layers with GELU activation, which adds nonlinearity and further transforms features.  \n   - The residual connections after each sub-layer help in stabilizing training and enable gradient flow, while layer norm ensures feature normalization.\n\n5. **Outcome of AFR:**  \n   By stacking six such layers, AFR adaptively weighs and enhances crucial features, suppressing less important ones, leading to refined feature representations that are more sensitive to the task at hand.\n\n6. **Integration for Riemann Geometry Projections:**  \n   The refined features generated by the AFR are then passed into the Riemannian Geometry Projection module, which treats the features as points on a manifold and computes local similarities accordingly. This means that AFR effectively prepares the feature embeddings such that their geometric properties in the Riemannian space are well-defined and optimized for subsequent processing.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\nThe Adaptive Feature Refiner (AFR) integrates self-attention and feed-forward layers by stacking six transformer encoder layers, each composed of multi-head self-attention (MSA) sub-layers and feed-forward neural network (FFN) sub-layers, encapsulated within residual connections and layer normalization. The MSA captures contextual dependencies within the feature sequence, while the FFN enhances feature representations through non-linear transformations. This layered architecture adaptively refines and weights the features extracted from text and point cloud inputs, producing enriched embeddings that are optimized and mapped into a common feature space. These refined features are then passed into the Riemannian Geometry Projection modules, ensuring that the features are suitable for meaningful similarity computation on the manifold."

The red box highlights the third component in the SBLLM framework: **Genetic Operator-inspired Chain-of-thought Prompting (GO-COT).**\n\n### Step 1: Understand what the red box represents\n\nFrom the figure and context:\n\n- The red box contains:\n  - \"Genetic Operator-incorporated Instructions\"\n  - \"Reasoning Specification\"\n  - \"Input Placeholder\"\n- This corresponds to the **GO-COT prompting** method described in the text under II-D.\n\nIn essence, GO-COT aids LLMs in evolving code by mimicking genetic operators (crossover and mutation) to combine and improve optimization methods iteratively. It guides LLMs stepwise in generating improved optimized code.\n\n### Step 2: Reason potential ethical considerations related to GO-COT\n\nFrom the detailed context, GO-COT involves:\n\n- Iterative and automated code rewriting based on evolutionary principles.\n- Heavily relying on LLMs generating new code snippets guided by instructions inspired by genetic operators.\n\nPossible ethical considerations stemming from this usage include:\n\n1. **Quality and correctness risks:**\n   - Although GO-COT improves code optimization, generated code might contain subtle bugs or security vulnerabilities.\n   - Automated code mutation could introduce errors hard to detect without thorough testing.\n   - Ethical responsibility for ensuring correctness and avoiding harm lies with developers/users.\n\n2. **Bias and misuse of generated code:**\n   - If the underlying training data or retrieval patterns contain biased or insecure code, it might propagate or amplify those biases or vulnerabilities.\n   - Reliance on automated prompts might reduce human oversight and critical code review.\n\n3. **Intellectual property and code provenance:**\n   - Since GO-COT uses patterns retrieved from large datasets and merges them to generate new code, there might be unclear boundaries on code ownership and licensing.\n   - Ethical concerns arise if proprietary or sensitive code patterns unintentionally leak or are reused without authorization.\n\n4. **Transparency and explainability:**\n   - The chain-of-thought approach offers some interpretability, but automated evolution methods might still generate complex code changes difficult for humans to fully understand or trace.\n   - Lack of transparency can raise ethical issues if critical systems rely on these autogenerated optimizations.\n\n5. **Impact on human developers:**\n   - Automation of code optimization might reduce opportunities for human developers to engage in learning and decision-making.\n   - Ethical concerns about job displacement or deskilling due to overreliance on AI-generated code.\n\n### Step 3: Check if the context section mentions ethical considerations explicitly\n\nThe provided excerpt does not explicitly discuss ethical considerations, risks, or societal impacts.

This transformation bridges raw protein 3D structure data into a sequence-like representation that is manageable for the model.\n\n2. **Context from the provided discussion:**  \n   The discussion addresses limitations relevant to structural pre-training and in particular mentions Foldseek:\n\n   - \"The performance of structural pre-training heavily depends on Foldseek [foldseek], which aims to balance search efficiency and encoding accuracy.\"  \n   - \"There is still room for improving the representation capability of all methods building upon Foldseek, including ours.\"\n\n3. **Extracting limitations of Foldseek in context:**  \n   - Since Foldseek balances **search efficiency** and **encoding accuracy**, this implies it prioritizes a compromise rather than perfect accuracy in representing protein structures.  \n   - This trade-off **limits the representation capability**—i.e., Foldseek's 3Di sequences may not capture the full nuance of the original 3D protein structures.  \n   - Hence, Foldseek might lead to **loss of detailed structural information** or **imperfect encoding** when converting complex 3D information into sequences.\n\n4. **Impact of this limitation:**  \n   - The less-than-perfect encoding affects the downstream pre-training and modeling tasks because the model relies on these encoded sequences.  \n   - This is highlighted as a current bottleneck and an area for future improvement in antibody structural representation learning.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\nThe main limitation of using **Foldseek** for encoding **protein 3Di sequences** is that, while it balances search efficiency and encoding accuracy, this trade-off constrains its representation capability. Consequently, the encoded 3Di sequences may not perfectly capture the detailed structural information of proteins, limiting the precision and expressiveness of downstream protein structure-based pre-training models like S²ALM. There remains room for improvement in encoding accuracy and representation fidelity in methods based on Foldseek."

This task involves antibody 1D sequences aligned or not aligned (matched/unmatched) with antibody 3Di sequences.  \nThe 3Di sequences are derived from antibody 3D structures encoded by Foldseek. The antibody 3D structures used include both experimentally-determined structures and computationally predicted structures (from ABodyBuilder2 and IgFold, as stated in the context).\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the nature of computationally predicted antibody structures**  \n- The text states that experimentally determined antibody structures are limited, so computationally predicted antibody structures are included to enrich the dataset for pre-training.  \n- These predicted structures come from ABodyBuilder2 and IgFold, which are prediction models made to overcome the limited availability of experimental data.\n\n**Step 3: Potential biases introduced by computationally predicted structures**  \nBy including large amounts of predicted antibody 3D structures in the training data and performing Sequence-Structure Matching (SSM), the model treats these predicted structures as ground-truth structural representations of antibodies. However:\n\n- **Prediction Errors:** Computationally predicted structures may contain inaccuracies or artifacts compared to experimentally determined ones. This could cause the model to learn structural patterns that are artificial or incorrect.  \n- **Domain Shift / Systematic Biases:** The folding prediction models may have inherent biases (e.g., favoring certain conformations or missing rare conformations) and thus the dataset skewed towards those predicted structural patterns.  \n- **Reduced Structural Diversity:** Predicted structures might systematically lack diverse or rare conformations that naturally exist, leading to less rich structure variations for model training.  \n- **Overfitting to Prediction Model Artifacts:** Because the predicted structures come from specific tools (ABodyBuilder2, IgFold), the model might indirectly learn features specific to these prediction methods rather than actual structural biology.\n\n**Step 4: Summarize the biases introduced in Sequence-Structure Matching due to predicted structures**  \nThe SSM task leverages sequence-structure pairs to discriminate true versus false matches. If the structural data contains predictive errors or systematic artifacts, this might cause:\n\n- Incorrect matching assessments based on imperfect structural annotations.  \n- Model learning to capture predicted-structure-specific biases instead of true antibody structural features.  \n- Potentially reduced generalization to experimental or real-world antibody structural data, due to bias introduced by predicted structures.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:  \n\nComputationally predicted antibody structures may introduce biases into the Sequence-Structure Matching task by incorporating inaccuracies, prediction artifacts, and systematic biases inherent to the structure prediction models (such as ABodyBuilder2 and IgFold). These biases can lead the model to learn artificial or less diverse structural patterns, potentially reducing the accuracy and generalizability of matching between sequence and true structural conformations. The reliance on predicted structures might cause the model to overfit to features specific to prediction algorithms rather than authentic antibody structural characteristics."

SSM enforces a coarse-grained global alignment, helping the model distinguish matching versus unmatching pairs, thus learning overall sequence-structure consistency. CLR complements this by fine-grained reconstruction of corrupted tokens using cross-conditioned information, capturing detailed interdependencies at the token level. Together, these tasks enable holistic antibody-specific multi-level learning essential for robust representation in Stage II.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe integration of Sequence-Structure Matching (SSM) with Cross-Level Reconstruction (CLR) in Stage II is motivated by their complementary roles in antibody-specific learning: SSM captures the coarse-grained global alignment between antibody sequences and structures to identify matching relationships, while CLR focuses on fine-grained token-level reconstruction using cross-level contextual information to explicitly learn detailed interdependencies. Their combination allows the model to effectively integrate multi-level sequential and structural information, fostering comprehensive antibody representation learning."

It takes the original input and generates a \"Noised Input\" by partially corrupting it using a mask (mask-out).\n- This concept aligns with denoising autoencoders where input data is partially masked or corrupted to prevent the autoencoder from simply copying the input and to encourage learning robust latent representations.\n\n### Step 2: Extract relevant details about corruption from the textual context.\n\n- In **Section II Proposed Model (II-A The Components: Sub-Autoencoders)**:  \n  > \"Large also utilizes the corrupt module to corrupt the input  to  using a mask-out technique.\"  \n  > This indicates that the corrupt module uses a mask-out technique to partially corrupt the input.\n  \n- In **II-B The Experts: Parent-Autoencoders**:  \n  > \"Since the hidden dimension is smaller than the input vector dimension, a sub-AE cannot fully recover its original input after encoding and decoding. This process performs denoising.\"  \n  Partial corruption forces the model to learn meaningful representations and reconstruct the missing/noisy parts.\n\n- The detailed formulation of the corrupting process itself is not explicitly mathematically described in this excerpt, but the mask-out technique typically refers to randomly selecting input positions to be masked (corrupted), commonly by zeroing or setting those entries to a constant value.\n\n### Step 3: How does the corrupt module determine mask positions?\n\n- The diagram shows three \"Noised Input\" boxes with some positions colored differently (highlighted in a beige or light color) among white ones — this visually indicates randomly or strategically selected mask positions.\n- The textual context states:  \n  > \"We also introduce a corrupt module to improve robustness by partially corrupting initial input, preventing sub-AEs from simply learning the identity function.\"  \n  This implies it uses **partial corruption via mask-out**, i.e., selecting some positions for corruption (masking) and leaving others unaltered.\n\n- The masking is **partial**, meaning only a subset of input features is masked.\n\n### Step 4: How does the corrupt module maintain input-data integrity during partial corruption?\n\n- By **only partially corrupting** the input while leaving the rest intact, the module ensures that the overall structure of the input data is kept, facilitating meaningful denoising learning.\n- This partial masking allows the autoencoders to rely on the non-corrupted parts to reconstruct the corrupted ones.\n- The module does **not corrupt all inputs at once**, avoiding complete loss of information.\n- This selective corruption lets the model learn to infer missing parts without seeing the entire original input, thus improving robustness.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Summary Answer:**\n\nThe **Corrupt Module** employs a *mask-out* technique to partially corrupt the original input by selectively masking out (i.e., setting to zero or a designated value) certain positions in the input vector. The positions to mask are determined by applying a mask that randomly or strategically selects a subset of input features to corrupt. By only partially masking some input elements and leaving the rest intact, the module maintains the overall input-data integrity. This partial corruption prevents the sub-autoencoders from simply learning identity mappings and encourages robust feature learning, while preserving sufficient input information to enable effective denoising and reconstruction.\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe Corrupt Module determines mask positions by applying a partial mask-out strategy that selectively masks (corrupts) some positions of the input vector, while leaving others intact. This partial corruption is done via a mask that designates certain input elements to be corrupted (e.g., set to zero) at random or through a fixed scheme. By only partially corrupting the input, the module preserves the integrity of the rest of the data, allowing the model to learn effective denoising without losing the overall information content of the input."

It takes input and produces gating weights (G) that control how outputs of different parent-AEs (experts) should be weighted.\n\n- **Blue Box (The Experts: Parent-AEs)**  \n  This depicts the three parent-AEs (Strong, Moderate, Mild Denoising), which act as experts producing outputs (denoised results).

This noisy gating encourages sparse selection and load balancing of the experts. The outputs (scores) of the gating network correspond to gating weights \\(G\\), which represent the contribution of each parent-AE expert.

This means parts of the input vector are intentionally masked out (set to zero or removed) to introduce noise.\n\n2. **Understand the Corrupt Module’s role (from text):**  \n   - The corrupt module partially corrupts the initial input to improve the model's robustness.  \n   - This is done to prevent sub-AEs from simply learning the identity function (which could happen if the input were always clean).  \n   - By corrupting the input, the autoencoders must learn to reconstruct missing or noisy parts, encouraging better feature learning and denoising capacity.\n\n3. **Understanding dropout in collaborative denoising autoencoders (from known knowledge and context):**  \n   - Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons or inputs are \"dropped out\" (set to zero) during training.  \n   - In collaborative denoising autoencoders, dropout also serves as a noise injection technique, forcing the network to rely on other parts of the input to reconstruct the complete data, thus improving robustness and generalization.  \n   - Dropout effectively corrupts the input or activations, similar to mask-out.\n\n4. **Parallel between mask-out and dropout:**  \n   - Both introduce noise or corruption into the input or intermediate activations.  \n   - Both aim to prevent the autoencoder from trivially copying the input or overfitting.  \n   - Both force the model to learn robust representations by reconstructing missing or corrupted parts.  \n   - In the context of this paper, mask-out is explicitly used as a corruption mechanism on the input, which aligns functionally with how dropout randomly \"drops out\" nodes or inputs.  \n   - The mask-out technique can be viewed as a structural, input-level dropout applied to the input vector directly, whereas dropout is more general but often applied similarly to inputs or hidden units.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe mask-out technique in the Corrupt Module parallels dropout in collaborative denoising autoencoders by both serving as deliberate corruption mechanisms that partially remove or mask input data during training. This prevents the autoencoders from simply learning the identity function and forces them to learn robust, denoising representations. Essentially, mask-out acts like input-level dropout, introducing noise that promotes improved generalization and denoising capacity."

Reduced Ambiguity:  \n   Modularization breaks down complex cinematic components into manageable perceptual units. Annotators can more easily distinguish between what is a camera movement versus shot size, leading to more consistent and reliable annotations.\n\n4. Easier Quality Control and Review:  \n   With modularized tasks, reviewers can check and validate responses for a specific feature independently. This granular approach helps spot inconsistencies or errors related specifically to camera movement or shot size separately.\n\n5. Improved Training and Prompting:  \n   Models and annotators use separate prompts tailored to the task modality, which limit ambiguity and guide focused annotation, enhancing the consistency of labeling.\n\n6. Better Benchmark Design:  \n   Such modularized annotation structures enable balanced question design and distractor construction that are appropriate for each task, improving the overall quality and reliability of the dataset.\n\nIn summary, modularizing annotation into camera movement perception ([mask1]) and shot size perception ([mask2]) improves labeling consistency by clarifying task scope, reducing ambiguity, providing focused and distinct label sets, simplifying quality control, and enabling more precise annotation and evaluation of complex cinematic features in videos."

Importantly, edges exist **only if the wireless signal strength between nodes is above a fixed threshold**—specifically mentioned as \"-75 dBm\" in the figure caption—to indicate sufficient link quality for carrier provisioning.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning using the context and figure-text alignment:\n\n1. **What is [mask1]?**  \n   The network’s graph representation (Step 2 in Figure 1) models the IoT network as a graph . Here, nodes () correspond to IoT devices, and edges () represent wireless links **with signal strength above a threshold**. Sensor tags are assigned as hosted by these nodes.\n\n2. **Why is the fixed signal-strength threshold used?**  \n   The edge set  includes only those node pairs with sufficiently strong wireless signal for carrier provisioning. This is necessary because battery-free sensor tags require an unmodulated carrier from a neighboring IoT node to communicate. A low signal-strength would fail to reliably deliver this carrier.\n\n3. **What does the fixed threshold imply?**  \n   It means that links with received signal strength below the threshold (e.g., -75 dBm) are **excluded** from the network graph because they are considered unfit to provide the carrier.\n\n4. **Possible limitations emerging from this fixed threshold?**  \n   Although the exact limitations are not explicitly stated in the provided text under [mask1], based on the problem description and wireless network principles, we can infer:\n\n   - **Exclusion of Potential Links:**  \n     Some links that are marginally below the threshold might actually be usable under certain conditions (e.g., with some retransmissions or environmental changes), but are excluded. This could reduce the flexibility of carrier assignment and overall network connectivity.\n\n   - **Static Threshold Ignores Dynamics:**  \n     The fixed threshold does not adapt to changing wireless conditions, interference, or environmental factors. A link that is valid at one time might be invalid later, or vice versa, without dynamic adjustment.\n\n   - **Reduced Graph Connectivity and Carrier Generation Options:**  \n     Limiting edges strictly based on the fixed threshold might yield a sparse graph, limiting the number of candidate carrier providers for sensor tags, which can impact schedule efficiency and increase the number of required carrier slots.\n\n   - **Impact on Scheduling Optimality:**  \n     Since the schedule computation depends on the graph structure, a fixed threshold can cause suboptimal scheduling if useful links are eliminated or if overly lenient thresholding admits weak links causing communication failures.\n\n5. **Supported by context:**  \n   The \"Challenges\" mention the NP-hard nature of the scheduling problem and the need for the scheduler to \"leverage the topological structure\" to reuse carriers efficiently. A fixed threshold that restricts connectivity limits this reuse potential.\n\n   Furthermore, the \"Motivation\" and \"Node-to-Tag Communication\" sections emphasize reliable carrier provisioning from neighboring nodes, which is directly related to the edges selected by the threshold. Using a conservative fixed threshold supports reliability but at the cost of flexibility.\n\n6. **Specific extracts relevant to fixed threshold limitations:**\n\n   - *“The connectivity among IoT nodes is determined by the wireless link signal strength, i.e., there is an edge between two nodes only if there is a sufficiently strong wireless signal for providing unmodulated carrier”* (Section 3).\n\n   - *“Multiple impinging carriers on a sensor tag causes interference, and prevents proper tag interrogations.”* Hence, the threshold also helps avoid interference by limiting carrier providers.\n\n   The fixed threshold is a simplification that may limit the scheduler’s ability to adapt to network variability.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary answer:**\n\n**The main limitations emerging from using a fixed signal-strength threshold in the network’s graph representation ([mask1]) are:**\n\n- It rigidly excludes links with signal strengths below the threshold, even if some might be usable under certain conditions, potentially reducing network connectivity and limiting carrier provider options.\n\n- It does not adapt to dynamic changes in wireless conditions, which can cause inaccuracies in representing the actual link availability.\n\n- This results in a sparser network graph, which restricts the scheduler’s ability to efficiently reuse carrier nodes for multiple tag interrogations.\n\n- Consequently, the fixed threshold may lead to suboptimal scheduling outcomes by preventing the exploitation of potentially viable links and limiting the network’s flexibility.\n\n---\n\nIf the question required an explicit quote or the exact phrase from the text, such direct statements about the limitations of the fixed threshold do not appear explicitly in the provided context. However, the above inferences are the logical limitations arising from relying on such a fixed threshold in the system.\n\n---\n\n# Final concise answer:\n\nThe fixed signal-strength threshold used to determine edges in the network graph limits connectivity by excluding links below the threshold—even if sometimes usable—and does not adapt to dynamic wireless conditions. This reduces the number of candidate carrier providers, restricting carrier reuse opportunities and potentially leading to less efficient or suboptimal scheduling."

This includes the overall scheduler system residing in the cloud or at the edge, responsible for generating the schedule.\n\n- The blue box (mask2) highlights the **RobustGANTT** component inside the Cloud/Edge Server. RobustGANTT is the **GNN-based Transformer** model that performs the actual scheduling computations in a learned, iterative graph neural network approach.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand what [mask1] and [mask2] refer to\n\n- [mask1] = Cloud/Edge Server  \n- [mask2] = RobustGANTT GNN-based Transformer scheduler\n\nThis means the question is asking about privacy risks that arise from **using the Cloud/Edge Server to run the RobustGANTT scheduler**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Understanding the system in context\n\n**From the text:**\n\n- RobustGANTT receives network information (MAC, routing info, graph topology, tag-to-host mapping) from the IoT network.\n\n- This data represents detailed structure of the network including:\n\n  - Identities of nodes (IoT devices)\n  - Their connectivity (who can provide carriers)\n  - Sensor tag assignments (which sensors are hosted by which IoT node)\n  - Possibly traffic or operation metadata if included\n\n- The scheduler must process this to compute a schedule that assigns timeslots/roles (carrier provider, interrogate tag, or idle).\n\n- The Cloud/Edge Server (mask1) holds this data and performs this computation, then disseminates the schedule.\n\n**Important points from the context:**\n\n- The system requires uploading detailed network information to the Cloud/Edge server.\n\n- The system interacts asynchronously with IoT networks, which may be geographically dispersed or owned by different entities.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Reasoning about privacy risks\n\nWhat privacy risks arise from using a Cloud/Edge Server to perform RobustGANTT scheduling?\n\n- **Data Exposure Risk:** Since detailed network topology and sensor tag assignments are sent to the Cloud/Edge server, potentially sensitive info about the network structure, device identities, and sensor deployments is exposed to the server operator. If the server is compromised or operated by an untrusted party, this data could be accessed or leaked.\n\n- **Inference Risk:** Knowing the topology and tag placement can reveal operational details about the environment being monitored—such as which nodes/sensors are critical, sensor coverage areas, and patterns of communication, which might be sensitive in certain contexts (medical implants, industrial machinery, critical infrastructure).\n\n- **Unauthorized Access / Data Leakage:** If communication between IoT network and Cloud/Edge server is not encrypted and authenticated, adversaries could intercept the transmitted network data or schedules, leading to privacy leaks.\n\n- **Schedule as Side Channel:** The published schedule itself reveals when and how sensors communicate and when carrier signals are provided. If schedules are observable, potentially adversaries might infer activity or status changes within the monitored environment.\n\n- **Centralized Processing Risk:** Using a centralized scheduler creates a single point of failure and privacy vulnerability, versus on-device or decentralized schedulers that keep data locally.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Is any privacy risk explicitly mentioned in the context?\n\nNo direct discussion of privacy risks is present in the provided text. The text primarily focuses on scheduling performance, resource savings, and scalability. However, since the scheduler requires gathering detailed network information on a central Cloud/Edge server, privacy risks naturally arise from this centralized data collection, processing, and dissemination.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nBased on the diagram and context, the privacy risks arising from using the **Cloud/Edge Server ([mask1])** to perform **RobustGANTT ([mask2]) scheduling** are:\n\n- Exposure of sensitive network topology and sensor tag assignment data to the Cloud/Edge server.\n\n- Potential unauthorized access or leakage of this data if the Cloud/Edge server is not fully trusted or properly secured.\n\n- Potential inference of sensitive operational or environmental details.\n\n- Risks related to interception of communication between the IoT network and the Cloud/Edge server.\n\n---\n\n# **Final Answer:**\n\nUsing the Cloud/Edge Server ([mask1]) to run the RobustGANTT ([mask2]) scheduler introduces privacy risks primarily due to the centralized collection and processing of sensitive network information. This includes exposure of detailed IoT network topology, sensor tag placements, and device identities, which could reveal sensitive operational or environmental data if the Cloud/Edge server is compromised, untrusted, or inadequately secured. Additionally, communications between the IoT network and the Cloud/Edge server might be intercepted, leading to data leakage or allowing adversaries to infer sensitive information from the scheduling patterns."

Normal verification of a watermarked image: Watermarked image → Verifier → Decoder → Extract Original Watermark\n\n  2. Verification after the DLOVE attack (i.e., after adding well-crafted perturbations): Watermarked image + Perturbations → Verifier → Decoder → Extract Target Watermark\n\n- Although the perturbations are crafted to overwrite the watermark, the verifier still processes the attacked watermarked image through the decoder to determine the watermark (which after attack may decode to the target watermark, not the original).\n\n- The presence of a verifier is crucial because:\n\n  * It mimics the real-life scenario where a user or system attempts to verify a watermark's authenticity.\n\n  * It is the step where the proof of ownership or copyright claim is established.\n\n  * Even after the perturbation, the verification step is necessary to demonstrate the attack's effectiveness, as the verifier is fooled into recognizing the attacker’s watermark.\n\n- In other words, the verifier validates whether the watermark extraction was successful or has been compromised.\n\nStep 4: Summarizing the justification\n\nHence, the \"Verifier\" is kept even after adding well-crafted perturbations because:\n\n- The verifier plays the critical role of validating watermark authenticity by decoding and comparing watermarks.\n\n- Even if the watermarked image is attacked (perturbed), the verification process remains the same; the decoder extracts whatever watermark is present, and the verifier compares it.\n\n- This step demonstrates the success of the DLOVE attack in overwriting the watermark to change ownership.\n\n- Removing the verifier step would skip the fundamental authentication process necessary for ownership claims.\n\n# Final Answer:\n\nThe \"Verifier\" step is kept post well-crafted perturbations because it represents the essential process of authenticating the watermark by extracting and validating it against expected watermarks. Even after perturbations designed to overwrite the watermark, the verifier must process the altered watermarked image to confirm whether the embedded watermark corresponds to the original owner or has been successfully replaced by the attacker’s target watermark. This step is crucial to demonstrate the attack’s effectiveness and to establish or deny ownership claims based on the decoded watermark."

Understand what \"Expert-guided\" involves:\n   - According to the figure and context, the Expert-guided approach replaces generic or ambiguous feature names (e.g., fLength) with **user-provided domain-specific descriptors** that explain the semantic meaning of each feature.\n   - This enriches the prompt with domain knowledge, e.g., replacing \"fLength\" with \"Major axis of the ellipse\".\n   - This requires human expertise but provides clear, meaningful feature names, better guiding the LLM.\n\n3. Understand what the \"Prompts For Finetuning\" box represents:\n   - This is where the constructed prompt (containing the enriched, domain-informed feature descriptions) is fed into the LLM for fine-tuning.\n   - The prompt construction (with better feature names) is provided as input to the LLM in the fine-tuning phase.\n\n4.

Identify [mask1]:  \n   According to the prompt, the red box highlights the \"Novel-mapping\" protocol in the figure.\n\n2. Understand what \"Novel-mapping\" involves from the diagram and text:  \n   - The figure shows \"Novel-mapping\" involves using an LLM (represented by the ChatGPT icon) to map generic attributes (with no meaningful names) to physics quantities based on the value ranges of the columns and a chosen domain (e.g., physics).  \n   - The textual context explains that Novel-Mapping is for datasets where feature names are completely generic or missing (e.g., \"Attribute 1\", \"Attribute 2\") and no expert or partially meaningful names exist.  \n   - The protocol queries an external LLM with a prompt requesting it to suggest suitable feature names/terms from a chosen domain, given the ranges of the columns. It specifically highlights the rules for suggestions: all terms should come from the same field/domain, and no two suggestions should be identical.  \n   - The chosen field name can be arbitrary but must produce feature names consistent with the LLM's prior knowledge and have values consistent with the given ranges.\n\n3. What ensures assigning consistent physics quantities?  \n   - The text states that for Novel-Mapping, the prompt rules ensure that the LLM provides terms/phenomena from the same domain (physics) so the feature names are consistent.  \n   - Consistency is maintained by specifying the domain, providing ranges that match real physical quantities in that domain, and enforcing uniqueness of terms.\n\n4. Therefore, the procedure that ensures consistent assignment is:  \n   - Querying an external LLM (such as ChatGPT) with a carefully constructed prompt that includes the ranges of column values and the chosen domain to generate consistent physics quantities as feature names.\n\nHence, the answer is that the \"Novel-Mapping\" protocol uses an LLM with domain-specific prompts incorporating value ranges and domain constraints to assign consistent physics quantities when constructing prompts for fine-tuning.\n\n# Final succinct answer:\n\nThe procedure is the \"Novel-Mapping\" protocol, which queries an external LLM with the column value ranges and a specified domain (e.g., physics) to generate consistent and domain-appropriate feature names. This approach ensures that assigned physics quantities remain consistent by enforcing that all suggestions come from the same domain and match the feasible value ranges."

Instead of using nominal time indexing, it indexes these references based on an adaptive task phase \\(\\phi\\), which evolves dynamically informed by the current system state and tracking performance. This phase-conditional selection transforms the offline bilevel plans into phase-indexed reference targets, which are then fed to the policy to guide robust tracking and execution despite modeling uncertainties and environmental disturbances.\n\n---\n\n# **Final concise answer:**\n\nThe Reference Selector transforms the Offline MCP’s comprehensive multi-contact trajectory and manipulation schedule by adaptively selecting specific reference states and contact modes indexed by a learned adaptive task phase. This phase-based indexing converts the full offline bilevel plans into instantaneous phase-conditional reference inputs (\\(\\mathbf{x}^*, \\mathbf{m}^*\\)) for the policy, enabling robust, flexible task progression and effective conditioning of the control policy on where it should be along the demonstration."

This modulation pauses or slows the phase when tracking deviations are large and speeds up the phase as tracking improves, enabling the policy to learn residual corrections that adapt the timing of demonstration references, thereby ensuring robust interactions and recovery from disturbances during loco-manipulation tasks."

This modulation allows the task phase \\(\\phi\\) to evolve adaptively rather than linearly, enabling the robot to speed up, slow down, or reverse the progression through the planned demonstration trajectory. The policy then outputs joint position commands \\(q_j^{cmd}\\) as residuals over the reference joint positions corresponding to the current adaptively adjusted task phase. Through this mechanism, the policy adaptively adjusts the joint commands to robustly track the reference trajectories while allowing recovery from disturbances and deviations during task execution."

So, [mask1] = \"VectorDB\".\n\n**Step 2: Understand the role of VectorDB in the system**  \nFrom the context and figure:  \n- The Dataloader slices external knowledge into chunks, converts these chunks into embeddings, and stores them in the VectorDB (vector database).  \n- During inference, prompts query the VectorDB to retrieve relevant information to augment the LLM responses.  \n- This process adds external up-to-date or domain-specific knowledge dynamically, which addresses the limitation of static knowledge embedded in LLM parameters.\n\n**Step 3: The nature of embeddings in VectorDB**  \n- Context mentions \"static embeddings\" implicitly by saying vector DB stores embeddings generated from external knowledge chunks.  \n- These embeddings are fixed representations of the knowledge as it existed when embeddings were computed.\n\n**Step 4: Limitation when external knowledge evolves**  \n- If external knowledge changes, the embeddings stored in VectorDB become outdated because embeddings are static (computed at one point in time).  \n- Continuous update and re-embedding of the knowledge base are required to keep the VectorDB current.  \n- If not updated, the VectorDB retrievals reflect outdated information, which undermines relevance and accuracy.  \n- This contrasts with LLM parameters embedding static knowledge fixed at training time but does not dynamically evolve.\n\n**Step 5: Summarize the limitation**  \nUsing VectorDB with static embeddings means that as external knowledge evolves, the embedded vectors in the database become stale unless regularly updated. This limits the effectiveness of RAG pipelines because:\n- There's a maintenance burden to update embeddings and the VectorDB continuously.  \n- The system can deliver outdated or inaccurate information if not updated.  \n- It may reduce the accuracy and relevance advantages expected from dynamic external knowledge integration.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\nThe limitation of using the VectorDB for static embeddings is that as external knowledge evolves over time, the embeddings stored in the vector database become outdated and no longer accurately represent the current information. This requires continual updating and re-embedding of the external knowledge to maintain relevance and accuracy. Without such updates, the retrieval results will be stale, limiting the effectiveness of RAG pipelines in delivering up-to-date and domain-specific knowledge."

        "response": "Let's carefully analyze the question and the context:\n\n---\n\n**Question:**  \nHow could [mask1] be enhanced to incorporate ethical safeguards for sensitive content generation?\n\n**[mask1]** refers to the highlighted area in the diagram, which is the **\"Inference Interface\"** component (marked by a red box).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the role of the \"Inference Interface\"\n\n- From the diagram:  \n  The \"Inference Interface\" connects the prompt inputs (from Few-shot Prompt Engineering and RAG components) to the final \"Responses\" output in the Execution phase. It likely represents the LLM model or service executing the actual inference (generation) on the prompts.\n\n- From context:  \n  > \"The query execution engine processes prompts generated by the dataloader and executes queries through the LLM inference interface. The default interface in this work is provided by the Ollama model hub... Custom models can be integrated into CEBench by implementing a customized inference interface.\"\n\n- This means the Inference Interface is the execution endpoint where model inference actually runs to produce responses.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: What do ethical safeguards for sensitive content mean?\n\n- Sensitive content generation risks can include generating harmful, biased, illegal, or privacy-violating content.\n\n- Ethical safeguards typically involve:\n  - Content filtering (pre- or post-generation): blocking inappropriate or harmful outputs.\n  - Bias mitigation techniques.\n  - User consent and data privacy enforcement.\n  - Safe-guard prompt engineering (e.g., safety prompts or instructions).\n  - Monitoring and logging problematic generations.\n  - Human-in-the-loop moderation.\n  - Usage policy enforcement.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: How to enhance the **Inference Interface** to incorporate ethical safeguards?\n\nSince the Inference Interface is the point where the LLM generates outputs from prompts, logical augmentation points are:\n\n1. **Input-side safeguards:**  \n   - Preprocess or evaluate prompts before sending them to the model for inference.  \n   - Detect and block potentially unsafe or sensitive prompts.\n\n2. **During inference safeguards:**  \n   - Use models fine-tuned on data that enforce ethical guidelines or safe generation.  \n   - Integrate guardrails or safety layers within the inference pipeline for real-time moderation.\n\n3. **Output-side safeguards:**  \n   - Post-process and filter generated responses for sensitive or harmful content before returning to users.  \n   - Reject or flag outputs that violate ethical policies.\n\n4. **Logging and monitoring:**  \n   - Record detailed logs of inputs and outputs for auditing and detecting abuse or bias.  \n   - Integrate with the Metric Scorer to include metrics related to content safety.\n\n5. **Human moderation & feedback:**  \n   - Offer interfaces for human reviewers to intervene when sensitive content is detected.  \n   - Use the collected human feedback to continuously improve safety mechanisms.\n\n6. **Policy-driven control:**  \n   - Add configuration to dynamically enable or disable safeguards based on application requirements.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Is there any direct mention of ethical safeguards or safety mechanisms in the context?\n\n- The provided text focuses mainly on benchmarking, cost-effectiveness, vector databases, prompt engineering, and performance monitoring.\n\n- There is no explicit mention of ethical safeguards in the system.\n\n- However, the system is designed to be modular and customizable:  \n  > \"Custom models can be integrated into CEBench by implementing a customized inference interface.\"\n\n- This means the Inference Interface can be extended or customized to enhance functionality, which implicitly allows for adding ethical safeguards.\n\n---\n\n### **Final reasoning and answer:**\n\nTo incorporate ethical safeguards in the **Inference Interface** (the red boxed component), it can be enhanced by integrating pre- and post-inference filtering mechanisms that detect and block sensitive or harmful content, fine-tuning or using safety-filtered LLM models, adding content moderation modules, logging for audit and monitoring, and supporting human-in-the-loop moderation workflows. These enhancements would ensure that the generated content is ethically appropriate and alignment with usage policies, reducing risks associated with sensitive content generation.\n\n---\n\n# **Answer:**\n\nThe Inference Interface can be enhanced to incorporate ethical safeguards for sensitive content generation by integrating pre-inference input filtering to block unsafe or sensitive prompts, employing LLMs fine-tuned for safe generation, embedding real-time moderation and content filtering mechanisms on the outputs, and logging inference interactions for auditing and monitoring. Additionally, it can support human-in-the-loop moderation to review flagged outputs. These enhancements would enforce ethical boundaries and ensure safer content generation within the LLM pipeline."

These continuous vectors are optimized through domain-specific loss functions (mask accuracy, restoration fidelity, and feature alignment) applied during few-shot tuning on target-domain data.

Global retrieval provides a broad, whole-image-based search that is effective for many forgery types, while local retrieval focuses on the detected forged segments to accurately identify original images especially in complex or multi-source forgeries and when forged objects are small. Combining both ensures all relevant original images are retrieved, improving recall and comprehensiveness in the fact verification process."

Instead of optimizing vertex positions directly, the method learns these Jacobian matrices for each triangle which encode local affine transformations (deformation gradients).\n\nTechnically, the new vertex positions \\( V^{new} \\) are obtained by solving a least-squares system built from these Jacobians \\( J_i \\):\n\n\\[\n\\min_{V^{new}} \\| \\nabla V^{new} - J_i \\|^2\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\nabla\\) is a discrete gradient operator over triangles.\n\nThis parameterization reduces degeneracies and local minima typical when directly modifying vertices.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: The role of the differentiable renderer and diffusion guidance\n\nDuring Stage I (coarse stage), the base mesh is deformed using learned Jacobians so that the rendered normal maps \\(I_N\\) from multiple sampled views resemble the text prompt through diffusion guidance.\n\nThe key here is:\n\n- Render normal maps \\(I_N = \\Phi(V^{new}, T^{new}, C)\\) using a differentiable renderer \\(\\Phi\\) from vertices \\(V^{new}\\) reconstructed from Jacobians \\(J_i\\).\n\n- Add noise to latent encoding of \\(I_N\\) as required by diffusion, feed it into pre-trained diffusion model denoiser \\( \\epsilon_\\theta \\).\n\n- Compute the Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) gradient: per-pixel gradient with respect to the noisy image latent that measures how well rendered images match the text prompt.\n\n- Backpropagate this gradient through the differentiable rendering pipeline to the mesh vertices \\(V^{new}\\), and further backpropagate it through the linear system relating \\(V^{new}\\) to \\(J_i\\), finally to the \\(J_i\\) themselves.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: How gradient propagates to optimize [mask2]\n\nThe blue box [mask2] \"Learned Jacobians and Material parameters\" is the joint set of parameters that are refined in Stage II using image refine guidance.\n\nThe coarse mesh Jacobians from [mask1] are **directly optimized by backpropagation of gradient** obtained from text-driven SDS loss computed on rendered images.\n\n- The differentiable renderer and diffusion model provide a differentiable pipeline from the Jacobians to rendered images to text alignment loss.\n\n- Mesh vertices positions \\(V^{new}\\) are a linear function of Jacobians \\(J_i\\), so gradients from image space can be backpropagated through this linear system to update \\(J_i\\).\n\n- Material parameters (texture parameters) are optimized jointly starting at Stage II by comparing rendered colored images with diffusion-refined images and minimizing an MSE loss.\n\nThus, the [mask1] represents the parameterization form (Jacobian matrices), and gradients flow back from the rendered images (guided by diffusion loss) through the differentiable renderer, and through the linear solve relating \\(J_i\\) and \\(V^{new}\\) to optimize \\(J_i\\), which are contained in [mask2].\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\nThe gradients to optimize the learned Jacobians for coarse mesh deformation ([mask2]) are computed by backpropagating the diffusion-based Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) gradients through the differentiable rendering pipeline. Specifically, rendered normal maps of the deformed mesh (parameterized by the Jacobian matrices in [mask1]) are compared against the input text prompt using a pre-trained diffusion model. The per-pixel SDS gradients in image latent space are propagated back through the differentiable renderer to the vertex positions, and then further back through the linear system linking vertex positions to per-triangle Jacobians. This enables direct gradient computation with respect to the learned Jacobians, allowing their optimization to deform the coarse mesh consistent with the text prompt. During the fine stage, these Jacobians and material (texture) parameters are jointly refined using additional diffusion-based image refiner guidance, closing the loop with rendered colored images.\n\n---\n\n# Short summary:\n\n[mask1] (\"Learned Jacobians\") compute gradients by backpropagating the diffusion model's SDS loss through a differentiable renderer and the linear system connecting Jacobians to vertex positions.

It parameterizes the mesh deformation through per-triangle Jacobian matrices instead of direct vertex updates, thereby enabling stable and geometry-aware deformation optimization. The SDS loss computed on normal maps guides the learning of these Jacobians via differentiable rendering and diffusion model feedback, effectively adapting DreamFusion’s implicit SDS framework for explicit mesh deformation in DreamMesh."

This tuning-free texturing involves projecting generated images from a pre-trained diffusion model onto the texture atlas, done progressively across views, but performed independently of mesh optimization and without explicit joint refinement.\n\n- In **Stage II (Fine stage)**, the coarse mesh and texture are **jointly refined**. Here is where [mask1] and [mask2] come in:\n  - The **Differentiable Rendering Pipeline ([mask1])** renders coarse colored images from the current mesh and texture parameters from random camera poses. This rendering pipeline connects the explicit 3D mesh and texture to image-space optimization.\n  - The **Image-to-Image Refiner ([mask2])** refines these coarse rendered images using a diffusion-based refiner model, producing a better-quality reference image.\n  \n- The refined image from the Image-to-Image Refiner is then used in an MSE loss to guide the joint optimization of both mesh deformation (via optimizable Jacobians) and texture parameters.

While the coarse stage produces initial textures independently of mesh changes, the fine stage jointly refines the mesh geometry and texture through differentiable rendering to produce coarse colored images, which are then improved by the diffusion-based image refiner. The refined images provide strong supervisory signals via an image loss that backpropagates gradients simultaneously to both mesh deformation (through Jacobians) and texture parameters. This synergy results in higher-quality, consistent textures and more faithful mesh shapes that surpass the limitations of the initial tuning-free texturing step, leading to more realistic and consistent 3D content."

This leads to ambiguous or incorrect pose estimations because Pose Optimization tries to fit the rendered template mesh such that its silhouette overlaps well with these part masks.  \n- Moreover, the pose optimization loss balance was found sensitive, since relying on IoU or part IoU alone was insufficient due to divergences between the template and target, implying that better segmentation helps disambiguate pose.\n\nIn **Section IV-C Experimental Results**, it is mentioned that:  \n- Failures in pose estimation are often linked to errors in the part segmentation step, such as missing parts (e.g., undetected wheels), which reduce \"Part Acc\" and cause errors in matching during Pose Optimization.  \n- Part segmentation inaccuracies cause pose ambiguity, misalignments in silhouettes, and ultimately pose optimization difficulties or incorrect convergence.\n\n### Step 3: Chain-of-thought conclusion\n\n- Since **Pose Optimization** relies on comparing the rendered silhouette of the template mesh with the **part masks** from the **Part Segmentation**, the quality of segmentation dictates the accuracy and clarity of the target silhouette.  \n- **High-quality, accurate, and complete part masks lead to a well-defined and reliable target silhouette**, allowing pose optimization to converge more accurately and robustly to the correct pose and template choice.  \n- **Poor-quality segmentation (missing parts, noisy masks, inaccurate boundaries) introduces ambiguity and errors, leading to poor or unstable pose optimization convergence**, as the rendering cannot be aligned well with the incorrect masks.  \n- Consequently, **better part segmentation quality improves pose optimization convergence in terms of speed, accuracy, and stability**.\n\n### Final answer:\n\nThe quality of **Part Segmentation** (red box) directly influences the convergence of **Pose Optimization** (blue box) because the pose optimization process uses the segmented part masks as target silhouettes to align the rendered template mesh. Accurate and complete part masks provide clear and reliable targets for optimization, enabling the pose parameters to converge accurately to the correct alignment. Conversely, poor segmentation quality with missing or noisy masks causes ambiguity and misalignment, hindering the pose optimization's convergence and leading to incorrect poses or failures. Hence, better part segmentation quality leads to faster, more stable, and more precise pose optimization convergence."

This can cause ambiguity or reduce matching precision when scene objects and parts share similar primitive dimensions but differ in shape details.\n- The method addresses this by using proportion-based normalized comparisons and overall proportional consistency checks to improve accuracy despite the simplification.\n\n### Step 4: Evidence from experimental results and discussion\n- From the evaluation section, the authors note that part proportions after primitive shape simplification mostly stay consistent with the original template mesh.\n- The success rate analysis shows failures related to certain part dimension mismatches (e.g., furniture legs being shorter causing silhouette misalignment), suggesting primitive simplification can limit fine alignment.\n- The authors suggest future improvements to allow \"per-part deformation\" to fine-tune part sizes beyond pure primitive shapes—indicating current simplification impacts correspondence precision.\n\n### Final synthesis:\nPrimitive shape simplification converts complex part geometries into manageable, comparable shapes (cuboids or cylinders), which simplifies the correspondence search in the scene by enabling dimension and proportion-based matching. This improves the robustness of correspondence finding given non-exact scene objects and limited shape variability. However, because fine-grained geometric details are lost, it can limit matching accuracy in terms of silhouette alignment and pose precision, especially when parts differ subtly in dimension or detailed shape from the simplified primitives. Thus, primitive simplification is a necessary trade-off to achieve feasible matching but at the potential cost of reduced correspondence accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Answer:**\n\nPrimitive shape simplification positively impacts correspondence accuracy in the Scene Matching step ([mask1]) by reducing complex parts to simple, comparable primitive shapes (cuboids or cylinders). This allows the search algorithm to effectively match parts and scene objects based on normalized dimension proportions and shape types, enabling robust matching despite non-exact correspondences. However, this simplification can also reduce fine-grained accuracy since detailed geometric features are lost, sometimes causing mismatches in silhouette alignment or part proportions. Overall, simplification enables feasible and systematic correspondence but at the cost of precision, motivating future improvements like per-part deformation to enhance accuracy."

        "response": "The question asks how leveraging [mask1] \"public data\" with [mask2] \"Contrastive Learning\" refines client-side feature discrimination under federated parameter aggregation.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning based on the given context and diagram:\n\n1. **Federated Learning Challenge**: In federated learning for face recognition, clients only have access to their own local private data and cannot share it due to privacy concerns. This makes it difficult to train discriminative models because negative samples (data from other identities) are not available locally.\n\n2. **Role of Public Data ([mask1])**: As shown in the diagram (middle pipeline), the server broadcasts a subset of various **public data** to clients. This publicly available dataset is unrelated to clients' private data but provides a shared reference background that clients can use during training.\n\n3. **Use of Contrastive Learning ([mask2])**: The clients use **Contrastive Learning** on a mixture of the downloaded public data and their own local private data. Contrastive learning works by pulling feature representations of similar pairs (positive pairs) closer and pushing apart dissimilar pairs (negative pairs).\n\n4. **How This Refines Feature Discrimination**:\n   - Since clients cannot access other clients' data, the downloaded **public data** serves as negative examples or as a representation of diverse identities, enabling clients to learn a better decision boundary.\n   - By performing **Contrastive Learning**, clients can compare their local data against public data features, effectively increasing inter-class variation and improving the discrimination of their own facial features.\n   - This joint use of public and local data with contrastive loss encourages the model to learn generalized as well as personalized discriminatory features, even though local clients only see their own data.\n\n5. **Federated Parameter Aggregation's Role**: The clients update their personalized models locally using this setup and send model parameters back to the server. The server aggregates these parameters, resulting in a global model improved through the collective learning across clients.\n\n**Summary**: Leveraging **public data** together with **contrastive learning** allows clients to train with both positive samples (local data) and effectively negative samples (public data) without sharing private data. This enhances local feature discrimination despite the constraint of federated parameter aggregation, leading to better personalized face recognition models that protect privacy.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer**:  \nLeveraging **public data** with **contrastive learning** allows clients in a federated learning setup to use publicly available diverse facial images as negative samples alongside their own local data. This enables clients to perform contrastive learning that pulls together features of the same identity while pushing apart different identities, effectively refining local feature discrimination. The combination helps overcome the lack of negative samples in private data and, through federated parameter aggregation, improves the personalized face recognition models without compromising user privacy."

Based on the context and figure, \"Label Smooth\" refers to the Label Smoothing technique applied to the labels of the generated EEG data within the \"Generated-Original Signals Reassemble\" data augmentation pipeline.\n\n2. Understand the role of Label Smoothing in the pipeline:  \n- Label smoothing is used to increase label entropy for generated EEG data.  \n- The original label is converted into a \"soft label\" by mixing the hard labels with uniform noise, controlled by a hyperparameter λ related to the closeness of generated data distribution to the real data distribution.  \n- This is done to prevent the EEG classification model from overfitting or learning incorrect information from imperfect generated data, by encouraging softer labels, i.e., less certain predictions.  \n- The context states this is necessary because directly incorporating generated data with hard labels often leads to learning incorrect information and performance degradation.\n\n3. What limitations might Label Smoothing introduce?  \n- Label smoothing assumes some knowledge or estimation about the closeness of the generated data distribution to the original data distribution (via λ). This estimation is crucial but challenging.\n\n- Excessive smoothing can lead to excessive uncertainty in the labels, making the training signal less precise and potentially slowing down convergence or reducing the maximum achievable accuracy.\n\n- Label smoothing works by softening the label distribution, which might blur class boundaries, leading to less discriminative features learned for the generated data parts.\n\n- For EEG classification tasks that are highly sensitive to precise class boundaries, label smoothing might reduce the clarity of the learning signal.\n\n- In the augmentation pipeline, the soft labels replace hard labels only for generated data, but if the smoothing parameter λ is not well-chosen, it might bias the learning either towards overconfidence or over-skepticism about generated samples.\n\n- Label smoothing does not directly improve the quality of generated data; if the generated data is of poor quality, smoothing just masks the problem without fixing it.\n\n- Additionally, label smoothing increases model entropy on generated data predictions, but this may cause challenges when combined with vicinal risk minimization (the combined loss function described) if the soft labels are inconsistent with the original labels.\n\n4. Match with the figure and text:  \n- The figure shows original data and generated data separately.  \n- The generated data gets a \"Soft Label\" through label smoothing.  \n- Then reassembled signals are generated from original and generated EEG via cropping and reassembling along the time dimension, producing vicinal data and labels.  \n- These vicinal data and labels are used with a KL divergence loss in training.  \n\nThus, the limitations of label smoothing within this pipeline may involve:\n\n- Dependence on accurately estimating λ to avoid overly soft or overly hard labels.  \n- Potential loss of label fidelity for generated data, possibly leading to suboptimal learning.  \n- Does not address the fundamental issue of generated data quality, only reduces the negative impact of incorrect labels.\n\n**Therefore, the possible limitations introduced by Label Smoothing to the Generated-Original Signals Reassemble augmentation pipeline are that it may reduce the precision of label information for generated data, possibly hindering the discriminative capacity of the EEG classification model, and that the smoothing parameter must be carefully tuned to balance between preventing overfitting to noisy generated data and preserving useful label information. Additionally, it does not improve the intrinsic quality of the synthetic EEG signals, so performance gains remain dependent on the generative model's output quality.**\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\nLabel Smoothing in the Generated-Original Signals Reassemble augmentation pipeline may introduce limitations such as reducing the precision and discriminative power of the labels for generated EEG data by softening them, potentially leading to less informative training signals. The effectiveness depends critically on the choice of smoothing parameter λ, which if improperly set, can cause either excessive uncertainty or misleading confidence in labels. Moreover, label smoothing does not improve the underlying quality of the generated data but only mitigates the negative effects of incorrect labels, meaning that if generated signals are of poor quality, it may not sufficiently prevent performance degradation."

This vicinal data (blue-red hybrid waveform) then is used in the EEG Classification Network with corresponding labels reassembled proportionally.\n\n3. **Why randomly reassemble generated and original EEG to form vicinal EEG?**  \n   From the textual explanation under \"Generated-Original Signals Reassembled Data Augmentation\":  \n   - Directly incorporating generated data into training can lead to suboptimal learning or even performance degradation because generated data distribution can deviate from the real data distribution. This can cause the model to learn incorrect information minimizing empirical risk only.  \n   - Label smoothing is applied to the generated data for softening the labels, but that alone does not solve the issue completely.  \n   - To better approximate the underlying true data distribution and improve diversity, the method generates vicinal data by random reassembly of original and generated signals.  \n   - This process increases the diversity of training data, expands the vicinal data distribution, and helps minimize not only the empirical risk but also vicinal risk, reducing overfitting and improving generalization.  \n   - The vicinal data and their soft (reconstructed) labels help the model learn from data points lying in between originally observed data, encouraging smoother decision boundaries.  \n\n4. **How does this fit into the overall loss optimization?**  \n   - The model is trained with a combined loss (GO loss): cross-entropy loss on original data and KL divergence loss on vicinal data.  \n   - This helps the classification network better generalize by learning from a more continuous and diverse data manifold created by mixing generated and original EEG data.\n\n**Final rationale summary**:  \nThe rationale for randomly reassembling the generated EEG and original EEG ([mask1]) to form vicinal EEG is to enhance the diversity and smoothness of the training data distribution. By creating these vicinal data points through stochastic cropping and recombining, the method effectively broadens the data distribution around the real data manifold, minimizing both empirical risk on training data and vicinal risk on augmented data. This reduces overfitting, mitigates the negative impact of the generated data distribution mismatch, encourages smoother decision boundaries, and ultimately improves the performance and generalization of the EEG classification network.\n\n---\n\n### **Answer:**  \nThe rationale for randomly reassembling the generated and original EEG signals ([mask1]) to form vicinal EEG is to increase the diversity of the training data by creating new intermediate data points that lie between real and generated distributions. This vicinal data helps the classification model minimize both empirical risk and vicinal risk, reducing overfitting and preventing the model from learning incorrect or overly confident predictions from generated data alone. By mixing segments of generated and original EEG signals randomly, the model is guided to learn smoother decision boundaries and better generalize across the true underlying EEG data distribution, leading to improved classification performance."

Instead:\n\n- Stage 1 optimizes only supervised learning (cross-entropy) on source data.\n\n- Stage 2 optimizes unsupervised loss (entropy minimization) on test data for each sample.\n\n- So the objectives are optimized separately in different stages, not jointly.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: From the question perspective — \"How are [mask1] objectives jointly optimized during [mask2]?\"\n\nBased on the above:\n\n- If referring to Self-TPT's Stage 1 objectives (joint supervised and self-supervised prompt learning), these are jointly optimized **only during Stage 1**, which is part of Stage 1 alone, not during the full blue box ([mask2]) of TPT which includes test-time adaptation and prediction.\n\n- In traditional TPT's [mask2], the joint optimization of supervised and self-supervised objectives does **not** occur; only supervised learning occurs in Stage 1, and unsupervised adaptation happens at test time separately.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Answer:\n\n**The supervised classification loss and self-supervised contrastive loss (the [mask1] objectives) are jointly optimized during Stage 1 (supervised prompt learning on source data), which is a subset of the blue box ([mask2]). During subsequent test-time adaptation (Stage 2) and prediction (Stage 3), unsupervised losses (e.g., entropy minimization) are applied per test sample, decoupling adaptation from prediction without joint optimization of the initial supervised and self-supervised objectives.**\n\nOr phrased more concisely based on the context:\n\n> The supervised and self-supervised objectives highlighted by the red box ([mask1]) are jointly optimized during Stage 1 of the blue box ([mask2]) via co-training on source data, using a combined loss function that includes cross-entropy loss for classification and a self-supervised contrastive loss. This joint optimization happens only in Stage 1; thereafter (Stages 2 and 3), test-time adaptation and predictions proceed separately without further joint optimization.\n\n---\n\n# **Final concise answer:**\n\nThe supervised classification loss and self-supervised contrastive loss ([mask1]) are jointly optimized during **Stage 1** of [mask2]—that is, during supervised and self-supervised prompt learning on source data—by co-training the two objectives with a combined loss function. Test-time adaptation (Stage 2) and prediction (Stage 3) proceed separately without joint optimization of these objectives."

Naively initializing entities with semantic features or converting semantic features into KNN edges leads to problems like reduced target distinguishability and message oversmoothing (as mentioned in Sec. 3.4).\n\n2. **Main goal of SCMP**  \n   SCMP aims to *leverage semantic features sufficiently* within the CMP framework while *avoiding performance degradation* due to semantic isolation or oversmoothing.\n\n3. **Two core techniques in SCMP for semantic augmentation**:  \n   a. **Semantic-injected Entity Initialization:**  \n   - Instead of initializing entity representations solely based on the query indicator (which results in 0 or 1 vectors), SCMP injects semantic neighbor labels into initialization.  \n   - Specifically, entities that are semantic neighbors (identified via unified semantic features and similarity measures) are initialized with a trainable vector, thereby allowing these neighbors to participate early on in message passing.  \n   - This improves target node distinguishability by preventing neighbor initialization from being all zeros, enabling effective higher-order semantic message propagation from the start.\n\n   b. **Global-local Semantic Encoding:**  \n   - SCMP employs *two separate CMP channels*:  \n     - A **local** channel that performs the original query-conditioned CMP, capturing standard relational message passing.  \n     - A **global** channel that performs CMP independently of the query, using all-ones vectors for relation initializations and semantic features for entity initializations.  \n   - The outputs of these two channels are merged by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to integrate both local topological and global semantic representations.  \n   - This dual encoding approach injects semantic features distinctly and directly into the message passing process, beyond just initialization, allowing semantic context to influence messages on both global and local scales.\n\n4. **Additional points:**  \n   - The global representations can be precomputed and reused, thus preserving time and space efficiency similar to CMP models.  \n   - Theoretical analysis guarantees SCMP’s expressiveness is at least as strong as CMP, so semantic augmentations do not reduce reasoning power.\n\n**Summary Answer:**  \n**SCMP extends CMP's conditional message passing by introducing two key semantic augmentations:** it injects semantic neighbor labels into entity initialization to enhance high-order semantic message propagation, and it employs a dual-channel global-local semantic encoding that separately processes global semantic features alongside local query-conditioned information.

SAM identifies \"where\" informative features are located by applying pooling along the channel axis, concatenating the results, and applying convolution to produce a spatial attention map. The intermediate feature map is then refined by element-wise multiplication with these attention maps, allowing Cervix-AID-Net to focus on the most relevant features for classifying cervical precancer risk.\n\n# Final answer:\n\nThe CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) draws on existing channel-attention and spatial-attention mechanisms for feature refinement by sequentially applying a Channel Attention Module (CAM), which focuses on \"what\" features are significant using average and max pooled descriptors and a shared MLP to generate channel attention maps, followed by a Spatial Attention Module (SAM), which determines \"where\" the informative parts are by pooling along the channel axis, concatenating, and applying convolution to generate spatial attention maps. These attention maps are then used to adaptively refine intermediate feature maps through element-wise multiplication, thereby enabling the Cervix-AID-Net model to emphasize the most relevant features in the input for improved classification performance."

Pixel RDE works directly on pixel features to produce a sparse mask highlighting important input features.\n\n5. CartoonX extends pixel RDE by moving from the pixel domain to the wavelet domain.\n\n6. By operating in the wavelet domain, CartoonX obtains masks that translate to smooth visual explanations (because wavelets capture piecewise smooth structures better), resulting in smoother and more interpretable explanations visually compared to pixel-wise masks.\n\nConclusion:\n\nCartoonX extends pixel RDE by performing rate distortion explanation (RDE) in the wavelet domain (position-scale domain) of the image rather than directly on pixels. This allows CartoonX to produce smoother, piecewise-smooth explanations by leveraging the wavelet representation before visualizing the masks back in pixel space.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\nCartoonX extends pixel RDE by executing the rate distortion explanation in the discrete wavelet position-scale domain of the image, producing wavelet masks that, when visualized, yield pixel-wise smooth (cartoon-like) explanations.

Understand the role of these models from the provided context and diagram (Fig. 1(a)):  \n   - From the text in Section IV-A:  \n     - The study fine-tunes DepRoBERTa and Llama3-8B on 500 labeled posts.  \n     - Qwen2-72B-Instruct is an LLM used with few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting to generate pseudo-labels for 1,500 unlabeled posts.  \n     - These three models (DepRoBERTa, Llama3-8B, and Qwen2-72B-Instruct) each independently predict labels on the unlabeled data.  \n     - Only posts for which all three models predict the **same labels** are retained as pseudo-labels (about 900 posts).

Gemma2-9B (fine-tuned)\n\n[Llama3-8B is thus represented by two fine-tuned models.]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: How are weights assigned?\n\n- From the context (IV-C):\n\n  > \"From 900 labeled data, we assign the ensemble weight \\( w_i \\) to the models, with a weight of **2 for Qwen2-72B-Instruct**, and a weight of **1 for the other four models**.\"\n\n- This means:\n\n  - Qwen2-72B-Instruct's prediction counts twice.\n  - Each of the other four models — including **both Llama3-8B variants** — count once.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Purpose and effect of weighted majority voting\n\n- The weighted majority voting aggregates predictions by weighting votes from each model.\n\n- Since Qwen2-72B-Instruct has **double weight**, its predictions have a stronger influence on the final decision.\n\n- The other models (including Llama3-8B) have equal weight but less than Qwen2-72B-Instruct.\n\n- This approach balances the contributions by:\n\n  - Leveraging the strong prompting capabilities and high performance of Qwen2-72B-Instruct (weight=2)\n  - Incorporating diverse perspectives from the fine-tuned LLMs (weight=1 each), including Llama3-8B, to bring complementary information and reduce individual biases.\n\n---\n\n### Final summary answer:\n\n**Weighted majority voting balances contributions from Llama3-8B and Qwen2-72B-Instruct by assigning a weight of 2 to Qwen2-72B-Instruct’s predictions, making them count twice as much, while assigning a weight of 1 to Llama3-8B (and other fine-tuned models). This means Qwen2-72B-Instruct’s predictions have stronger influence on the final ensemble output, yet Llama3-8B and the other models still contribute equally but less prominently, enabling a balance between the strong prompting model and fine-tuned classification models for a robust and performant suicide risk classifier.**"

This model leverages few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting to produce detailed and interpretable response formats, helping to classify user posts into suicide risk categories.\n\n2. **Why rely on multiple models, not just one?**  \n   The study uses **three models** for pseudo-labeling: Qwen2-72B-Instruct (prompting), DepRoBERTa (fine-tuned classifier), and Llama3-8B (fine-tuned classifier). The posts are retained only if **all three models agree on the label**, which reduces noise and biases associated with any single model.\n\n3. **Potential ethical concerns of relying solely on Qwen2-72B-Instruct**:  \n   - **Risk of noisy or incorrect labeling**: Although Qwen2-72B-Instruct is a powerful LLM, it is still an AI system prone to errors, especially on subtle, ambiguous, or sensitive posts involving suicidal ideation where nuanced understanding is required. Incorrect labels could misrepresent the risk level of a user, potentially leading to under- or overclassification.\n   - **Model-specific bias**: Relying solely on one model can cause systematic bias from that model's training data, architecture, or prompting style, which might not be fully representative or accurate for diverse real-world posts.\n   - **Lack of human oversight**: Although some manual prompt design and verification steps exist, fully trusting an automated LLM for such sensitive annotations bears ethical risk since AI decisions can affect resource allocation to at-risk individuals.\n   - **Misinterpretation of context and nuances**: The text mentions specific failure modes where the LLM misinterprets posts (e.g., posts from individuals who previously attempted suicide but now show signs of recovery). Without cross-checking, these mistakes might propagate.\n   - **Transparency and explainability issues**: While prompting Qwen2-72B-Instruct produces interpretable labels, full transparency and accountability are limited compared to expert human annotation.\n\n4. **Mitigation strategies described in the study**:  \n   - Using multiple models to filter pseudo-labels (agreement voting) to only keep high-confidence labels.\n   - Fine-tuning smaller models afterward with this cleaner pseudo-labeled data.\n   - Future prospect of involving domain experts for improved prompt engineering.\n\n### Final answer to the question:\n\n**Potential ethical concerns from relying solely on Qwen2-72B-Instruct for pseudo-label generation include:**\n\n- Risk of producing noisy or inaccurate labels due to AI model errors on complex, sensitive suicidal content, which could lead to misclassification of individuals’ suicide risk.\n- Introduction of model-specific biases that are not counterbalanced by other perspectives or models.\n- Over-reliance on an automated system without human expert oversight, which raises accountability and safety issues given the high-stakes nature of suicide detection.\n- Difficulty in fully capturing nuanced or context-dependent cues in posts, such as recovery signals, potentially resulting in harmful mislabeling.\n- Limited explainability and transparency compared to human annotation, which could affect trust and ethical deployment in real-world settings.  \n\nTherefore, while Qwen2-72B-Instruct is powerful, the study ethically mitigates these concerns by combining it with other fine-tuned models and only keeping labels agreed upon by all models, reducing noise and bias in pseudo-label generation."

The Macro Double Soft F1 loss function specifically optimizes for the F1 score by making it differentiable and thus better aligns the model’s training objective with the evaluation metric, resulting in performance improvements over standard losses like Cross Entropy. If other loss functions—such as Cross Entropy—were used instead, the models might not optimize directly for the F1 metric, potentially leading to lower effectiveness in handling class imbalance and overall classification accuracy on the suicide risk dataset. Therefore, alternative loss functions that do not align tightly with the evaluation metric could reduce fine-tuning efficacy, while loss functions tailored for imbalanced multi-class classification might improve it.\n\n# Final concise answer:\n\nAlternative loss functions could impact the fine-tuning efficacy of **LLaMA3-8B** and **Gemma2-9B** by affecting how well the training objective aligns with the evaluation metric (F1 Score). Using standard losses like Cross Entropy may lead to less effective optimization of F1 and poorer handling of class imbalance, resulting in reduced classification performance. In contrast, the Macro Double Soft F1 loss used in this work directly optimizes a differentiable approximation of F1, yielding better fine-tuning efficacy and improved suicide risk classification. Thus, choosing alternative loss functions that are less tailored to the F1 metric may diminish fine-tuning performance, whereas more suitable alternatives could potentially enhance it."

This residual encodes frame-to-frame changes representing motion information.\n\n4. **Combining TA and Resi before Quantization:**  \n   The temporal latent \\( z_h^T \\) used for quantization is formed by fusing the outputs of TA and Resi modules via element-wise addition:\n   \\[\n   z_h^{T} = z_h^{TA} + z_h^{Resi}\n   \\]\n   This combined temporal latent better represents both temporal dependencies (from TA) and explicit motion changes (from Resi).\n\n5. **Motivation:**  \n   The text explicitly states that directly applying spatial-only codebooks to videos leads to poor temporal consistency and flickering. The temporal codebook alone may fail to capture complex motion features if only motion residuals or attention features are used. By combining TA and motion residuals before quantization, the method can more comprehensively encode temporal dynamics:\n\n   - TA captures long-range temporal dependencies and contextual information over multiple frames.\n   - Motion residual captures fine-grained, explicit frame-to-frame changes.\n\n   Their combination allows the temporal codebook to better store temporal shifts and motion dynamics, resulting in improved temporal consistency and global coherence in the reconstructed video face.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\nCombining temporal attention (TA) and motion residual before quantization in STLookUp is motivated by the need to comprehensively capture temporal dynamics in video face enhancement. The TA module aggregates inter-frame temporal context to encode temporal dependencies, while the motion residual explicitly represents frame-to-frame motion changes. Their fusion provides a richer and more robust temporal latent representation, enabling the temporal codebook to better capture motion information and maintain temporal consistency, thereby reducing flickering and improving global coherence in the reconstructed high-quality face videos."

Specifically:\n\n1. **Pre-trained Feature Network (DINOv2):** Using a frozen pre-trained feature extractor like DINOv2 provides rich, robust, and diverse feature representations from the input videos. Since this network is pre-trained on large-scale data, it captures meaningful spatial and semantic information that can guide the discriminator more effectively than a randomly initialized network. This helps in better distinguishing real versus reconstructed HQ face videos.\n\n2. **Frozen Weights for Stability:** Freezing the pre-trained network ensures that its learned features remain stable and do not deteriorate during adversarial training, which contributes to stable training dynamics and avoids mode collapse or instability in GAN training.\n\n3. **Multi-scale Discriminator Heads:** Adding multiple lightweight, trainable discriminator heads at different scales enables the discriminator to evaluate the reconstructed videos at various spatial resolutions and levels of detail. This helps in detecting artifacts or inconsistencies both globally and locally, improving the quality and realism of reconstructed videos.\n\n4. **Stabilizing Model Training and Reducing Artifacts:** Taken together, this architecture mitigates the instability and artifact-prone nature often encountered when training video-level VQGANs by providing powerful, consistent feedback signals during adversarial learning.\n\nIn summary, the combined use of a frozen, pre-trained DINOv2 network and multiple trainable multi-scale discriminator heads forms a robust discriminator setup that stabilizes training and enhances the discriminator’s ability to guide the generator toward producing higher-quality, realistic, temporally consistent HQ face videos."

The arrows indicate bringing closer the mask feature vectors (from the prompt mask token) of the same label and pushing apart those of different labels. This corresponds to learning the distinctions between hateful and non-hateful samples at the *feature level*.\n\n- The **blue box (mask2)** shows for an individual sample, the [mask] feature vector of the inference instance should be close to the special token feature vector of demonstrations with the same label and distant from those with different labels (e.g., the [mask] vector of a hateful sample close to the [bad] token and far from the [good] token, and vice versa for non-hateful cases). This is a finer-grained contrastive learning between the inference instance's mask vector and the prompt's labeled special token vectors.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify the losses and their purpose from the text\n\nIn section **3.3 Prompt-aware Contrastive Learning**, the text explains:\n\n- **Category-oriented contrastive learning (Loss \\( \\mathcal{L}_1 \\))**  \n  Focuses on bringing close the mask feature vectors \\( \\boldsymbol{h}_\\text{mask} \\) of samples with the same *category* (hateful or non-hateful), while pushing apart those from different categories in the feature space.  \n  - This enhances **feature discriminability** of different categories at the sample level.  \n  - Corresponds to the red box in the diagram.\n\n- **Prompt-oriented contrastive learning (Loss \\( \\mathcal{L}_2 \\))**  \n  Focuses on aligning the [mask] token's feature vector \\( \\boldsymbol{h}_I^\\text{mask} \\) from the inference instance with the special token feature vectors from the demonstration prompts of the *same* label, while distancing it from those of *different* labels.  \n  - This facilitates interaction and association between the inference sample and contextual label information encoded in the prompts (special tokens like [bad], [good]).  \n  - Corresponds to the blue box in the diagram.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Why combine these two losses?\n\nFrom the context and the figure caption:\n\n- Combining **Loss 1** and **Loss 2** improves the **quality of feature distribution** for hateful vs. non-hateful samples by addressing two related but distinct aspects:\n\n  1. **\\( \\mathcal{L}_1 \\) (Category-oriented loss):**  \n     Strengthens intra-class compactness and inter-class separability purely at the mask token feature vector level among all samples in a batch—this shapes the general clustering of hateful and non-hateful samples in feature space.\n\n  2. **\\( \\mathcal{L}_2 \\) (Prompt-oriented loss):**  \n     Enhances the *alignment* between the feature representation of inference samples and the *semantic prompt tokens* that encode label information, providing a finer semantic grounding and leveraging the prompt’s label clues to aid classification.\n\n- This joint strategy leverages both **sample-level discrimination** and **prompt-based semantic alignment**, helping the model better capture differences and semantic relations between hateful and non-hateful categories at the feature representation level.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\nThe motivation for combining losses [mask1] (category-oriented contrastive loss) and [mask2] (prompt-oriented contrastive loss) within Prompt-aware Contrastive Learning is to jointly enhance the model’s ability to differentiate hateful and non-hateful samples by:\n\n- Ensuring that feature vectors of samples with the same label are clustered closely while those with different labels are pushed apart (category-oriented learning - red box), and simultaneously\n- Aligning the [mask] token’s feature representation of the inference instance with the prompt’s special token features that encode the corresponding label, while distancing it from the opposing label token (prompt-oriented learning - blue box).\n\nThis combination improves the feature distribution's discriminability and semantic consistency between inference samples and demonstrations, leading to better classification performance.\n\n---\n\n**In short:**  \nThe combined losses bring closer the mask token features of samples sharing the same category and align them with the prompt tokens representing their labels, while pushing apart those from different categories or labels, thereby boosting classification accuracy through improved feature discrimination and semantic alignment.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of chain-of-thought reasoning:\n\n- Red box loss = category-level contrastive learning on mask token features among samples.  \n- Blue box loss = contrastive learning aligning inference [mask] token with prompt special tokens of the same label.  \n- Combining these losses ensures the model learns both broad class separability and fine-grained semantic alignment with prompt-based label cues, improving hateful meme classification.\n\n---\n\n## Final concise answer:\n\nCombining losses [mask1] and [mask2] in Prompt-aware Contrastive Learning is motivated by the need to simultaneously enhance feature discriminability between hateful and non-hateful samples (category-oriented loss) and to align the inference instance’s [mask] token features with the label-specific prompt tokens (prompt-oriented loss). This joint optimization encourages samples of the same category to cluster closely while ensuring the semantic consistency of features with corresponding prompt tokens, thereby improving the model’s ability to distinguish hateful memes more effectively."

Each segment's embeddings are separately input as sequential token embeddings into dedicated LSTM modules (i.e., one LSTM per region). Each LSTM processes these region-specific embeddings to extract a global feature vector representing that region's overall content. This approach allows the model to capture distinct global features from the different regions within the same input sequence.\n\n---\n\n# **Answer:**\n\nThe embeddings output by RoBERTa ([mask1]) for the entire concatenated input sequence are partitioned according to fixed, predefined regions for the inference instance, hateful demonstrations, and non-hateful demonstrations. Each region's embeddings are extracted by slicing the corresponding token embeddings from the full RoBERTa output.

This reduces token usage, enabling more efficient LLM processing with faster inference and less GPU memory consumption.\n\n3. **Token-based Encoding in Context Optimizer**:  \n   The token-based encoding method attempts to rewrite table cell content using fewer tokens. Key points include:  \n   - Sorting table cells by token length to address collisions more efficiently.  \n   - For single-token cells, content remains unchanged (Single Token Preservation).  \n   - For multi-token cells, attempt to represent content using only two tokens for compactness, which balances semantic richness with token reduction.  \n   - Handling of bracket sequences to prevent syntax errors.  \n   - This encoding is dynamic and input-dependent, ensuring uniqueness and compactness in token representation.\n\n4. **Relation to Subword Tokenization Methodologies**:  \n   - Traditional subword tokenization (e.g., BPE or SentencePiece) breaks words into subword units to handle rare or out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and reduce vocabulary mismatches. However, domain-specific or rare terms (like pharmaceutical names) can cause tokenization to generate multiple tokens for a single concept, increasing token count.  \n   - The Context Optimizer’s token-based encoding goes beyond standard tokenization by **actively rewriting or aligning the cell content closer to the tokenizer's vocabulary** to reduce tokens needed while preserving uniqueness and meaning.  \n   - This reduces vocabulary mismatches by mapping complex or multi-token domain terms into shorter token sequences, similar in spirit to subword tokenization but done dynamically on input content with heuristics tailored to the domain and table structure.\n\n### Summary answer:\n\nThe **Context Optimizer’s Token-based Encoding** draws on subword tokenization methodologies by dynamically transforming the content of each HTML table cell into fewer tokens that are closer to the tokenizer’s vocabulary. It reduces vocabulary mismatches by rewriting or encoding multi-token cell contents into compact token sequences—often two tokens—while preserving uniqueness and semantics. This approach minimizes token count and optimizes the input for the LLM, similar to how subword tokenization handles rare and out-of-vocabulary terms, but applied as a dynamic, context-driven preprocessing step designed specifically for complex domain-specific tables.\n\n---\n\n### Final concise answer:\n\nThe **Context Optimizer’s Token-based Encoding** employs dynamic rewriting of cell contents to align them closely with the tokenizer’s vocabulary, reducing token counts by encoding multi-token phrases into shorter, unique token sequences. This method leverages principles of subword tokenization—such as breaking down or combining tokens to better match the vocabulary—in order to reduce vocabulary mismatches and enhance token efficiency, ultimately improving LLM processing of complex, domain-specific tables."

This weighted linear combination balances personalization (local information) and generalization (global knowledge), effectively enhancing feature alignment under frozen vision and text encoders.

It extracts image features from input images, mapping input images into a shared latent feature space aligned with text features generated by the Text Encoder \\(h\\).\n\n2. **Why is the Image Encoder frozen during training?**  \n   As shown by the snowflake symbol (❄️) in both the image and explained in the context, the Image Encoder is kept frozen to reduce computational cost, avoid overfitting, and leverage the powerful pre-trained representations of the vision-language model without retraining the entire backbone.\n\n3. **What prompts are trainable during federated learning?**  \n   The global and local text prompts are trainable (highlighted with a flame symbol 🔥) and updated through federated aggregation, which is the core of the PromptFolio method. The image encoder weights remain fixed.\n\n4. **What limitations arise by freezing the Image Encoder while updating the global and local prompts?**\n\n   - **Lack of Adaptation to Local Data Features:**  \n     Since the image encoder is not updated, it cannot adapt its feature extraction to local client data distributions, which might be heterogeneous or non-i.i.d. This limits the ability to capture specific local visual cues or task-specific variations present in client data.\n   \n   - **Restricted Feature Learning Capacity:**  \n     Prompt learning adapts the model only through the text prompt vectors. By freezing the image encoder, the model does not learn new representations or refine the existing ones for images, which may restrict overall learning capacity and limit performance.\n\n   - **Dependency on Pre-trained Features:**  \n     The quality and representation power depend entirely on the pre-trained frozen model. If these are imperfect or less optimal for the federated task, there is no way to improve the image representation through training.\n\n   - **Potential Suboptimal Global-Local Collaboration:**  \n     While combining global and local prompts helps balance generalization and personalization, frozen image features might be a bottleneck that prevents the system from fully exploiting visual variations across clients.\n\n5. **Supporting context from the Conclusion:**  \n   In the conclusion, the authors mention a limitation of their work being a simplified text model with a single activation function and suggest that future work involves exploring more complex models to better capture deep network behavior. Although this refers more explicitly to the text side, it implies that freezing the image encoder also limits depth of adaptation.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\nWhen freezing the **Image Encoder** while updating the global and local prompts, the following limitations arise:\n\n- The Image Encoder cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of local client data, limiting the extraction of client-specific visual features.  \n- The model's feature learning capacity is restricted because the image representations remain fixed and do not improve with training.  \n- Performance depends entirely on the pre-trained frozen model’s feature quality, which may not be optimal for all federated tasks.  \n- This freezing may limit the full benefit of global-local prompt cooperation, as the image side of the model cannot personalize or generalize effectively."

        "response": "Let's analyze the question step-by-step and reason based on the provided diagram and detailed textual context.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify [mask1] and [mask2] from the diagram and context\n\n- **[mask1] (highlighted by red box):**  \n  This area in the diagram corresponds to the **distance metric learning module** that calculates the **voxel-wise pixel distance** between features extracted from the original image and the flipped image.  \n  The context specifies this as the **\"metric-based margin loss\"** component (Section 3.2.1) which explicitly computes a voxel-wise margin loss between symmetric and asymmetric regions. This loss pushes apart the feature representations of tumor areas (asymmetric) and pulls together normal symmetric areas.\n\n- **[mask2] (highlighted by blue box):**  \n  This area corresponds to the **projection head module**, a non-linear projection consisting of several 1x1x1 convolution layers.  \n  The context explains this is designed to transform the encoder output feature maps before the metric learning step, helping to filter out irrelevant asymmetries not related to tumor pathology (Section 3.3.2).\n\nSo, the question is:\n\n> \"What alternative metric learning techniques could replace the [mask1] to enhance asymmetry sensitivity without additional [mask2]?\"\n\nIn other words, what other distance metric learning (contrastive loss) methods exist that might improve asymmetry sensitivity **without relying on the extra projection head module?**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Understand the role of the current [mask1] and [mask2]\n\n- The current [mask1] implements a **voxel-wise margin loss** between symmetric and asymmetric paired features (a form of contrastive learning).  \n- The current [mask2] projection head helps feature quality by learning a non-linear transformation before applying the metric learning loss.\n\nFrom the ablation study (Sec. 4.4.1), margin loss alone without the projection head **performs worse or no better** (margin loss alone lowers DSC, ASD, HD95). Adding the projection head substantially improves performance.  \nThis suggests the projection head helps the metric learning loss focus on relevant task-related asymmetries, enhancing the learning.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Consider alternative metric learning techniques that could replace the current voxel-wise margin loss ([mask1]) \n\nGiven the context and current margin loss formulation, alternative metric learning methods to improve asymmetry sensitivity could be:\n\n1. **InfoNCE loss / Noise-Contrastive Estimation (NCE)**  \n   - Widely used in contrastive representation learning.  \n   - Encourages positive pairs to be close while pushing apart many negative pairs.  \n   - Advantage: Effective at learning discriminative features directly without an explicit margin hyperparameter.  \n   - Could be adapted voxel-wise between symmetric and asymmetric voxels.  \n   - Potentially could eliminate the need for a nonlinear projection head if designed carefully.\n\n2. **Triplet loss**  \n   - Uses triplets: anchor, positive, negative.  \n   - For each voxel feature, the anchor could correspond to a location with a tumor, positive could be the symmetric voxel without tumor, and negative could be a voxel with different semantic content.  \n   - By maximizing margin between positives and negatives, triplet loss boosts feature discriminability.  \n   - Usually requires careful triplet mining but can work without projections if backbone features are well structured.\n\n3. **Contrastive loss with learned temperature / adaptive margin**  \n   - Instead of fixed margin, learn the margin or temperature parameter controlling class separation.  \n   - Could be more robust improving asymmetry sensitivity.\n\n4. **Center loss or Variance-based losses**  \n   - Encourage features of symmetric normal voxels to cluster tightly around a center, and tumor voxels to form separate clusters, enhancing separability.\n\n5. **Wasserstein or Optimal Transport-based metrics**  \n   - Instead of L2 voxel-wise distances, these metrics measure distributional differences, possibly capturing asymmetry more globally and sensitively.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Would these alternatives still require the projection head ([mask2])?\n\n- The projection head in contrastive learning is often used to improve the representation for metric learning by mapping to a space where the loss is more effective (e.g., SimCLR uses it) and helps keep the main encoder features intact for downstream tasks.  \n- However, some alternative losses (e.g., triplet loss or supervised contrastive loss) have been applied successfully **without additional projection heads**, particularly if the backbone network is sufficiently strong and regularized.\n\n- Moreover, learned temperature or adaptive margin losses can incorporate feature scaling and ensure stable gradients even **without a projection head**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary / Direct Answer to the Question:**\n\n**Alternative metric learning techniques that could replace the current voxel-wise margin loss ([mask1]) to enhance asymmetry sensitivity without employing an additional nonlinear projection head ([mask2]) include:**\n\n- **Triplet loss:** Using anchor-positive-negative voxel triplets aligned by symmetric and asymmetric regions to explicitly enforce margin separation of tumor features.  \n- **InfoNCE (supervised contrastive) loss:** Extending traditional contrastive loss where positive pairs are symmetric non-tumor voxels and negatives include asymmetric tumor voxels, leveraging many negatives for stronger feature discrimination.  \n- **Adaptive margin or temperature-scaled contrastive loss:** Learning margins or temperatures during training to better separate asymmetric and symmetric features without requiring a projection head.  \n- **Center loss or clustering-based feature compactness losses:** Enhancing feature clustering of normal symmetric voxels distinct from tumor voxels.  \n- **Distributional metric learning (e.g., Wasserstein distance):** Measuring distances between feature distributions of symmetric vs asymmetric regions rather than strictly voxel-wise distances.\n\nBy carefully designing and applying these metric learning losses directly on encoder features (potentially with stronger regularization or normalization), the projection head may be omitted while still improving asymmetry sensitivity.\n\n---\n\n# Final concise answer:\n\nAlternative metric learning techniques that could replace the voxel-wise margin loss ([mask1]) to enhance asymmetry sensitivity without requiring the additional projection head ([mask2]) include triplet loss, InfoNCE (supervised contrastive) loss, adaptive margin or temperature-scaled contrastive loss, center loss, and distributional metric learning methods (e.g., Wasserstein distance). These losses can directly encourage feature discrimination between symmetrical normal areas and asymmetrical tumor regions, potentially making the nonlinear projection head unnecessary if carefully implemented."

Each epoch, two unique models (selected paths) are trained on the same input.  \n- The loss function in this diversification step contains two parts:  \n  1. **Accuracy loss:** measures how close the prediction from the updated model on the input is to the ground truth.  \n  2. **Consistency loss:** measures how much the predictions of the two different models for the same input differ from each other.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Why balance accuracy and consistency losses?\n\n- The **accuracy loss** ensures that the model predictions are close to the known true labels, driving learning in the traditional supervised sense: \"fit the data.\"  \n- The **consistency loss** enforces that different models (different paths/candidate blocks) produce similar outputs given the same input, encouraging consensus or agreement among diversified subnetworks.\n\nIf only accuracy loss is optimized:  \n- Each model might specialize independently, potentially resulting in high variance across models and thus unstable or less reliable ensembles.\n\nIf only consistency loss is optimized:  \n- Models might all converge to similar outputs, sacrificing diversity and possibly reducing the overall expressiveness and robustness of the ensemble.\n\nBalancing the two losses allows:  \n- Maintaining **accuracy** by fitting the data correctly.  \n- Promoting **consistency** so the ensemble predictions agree and are stable, which, combined with diversity from shuffled blocks, creates a robust and well-regularized model pool.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Supporting evidence from the text and figure\n\n- From the text:  \n  > \"The loss function is then augmented with a regularization term that addresses the discrepancy between these two predictions, in addition to the standard error term that measures the deviation between the ground truth and the prediction.\"  \n  > \"During back-propagation, only the candidate blocks along the active path... are updated.\"  \n  \n- This matches the red box figure details about balancing \\( L_{ACC} \\) and \\( L_{CON} \\).\n\n- The diagram shows gradients are computed with respect to both losses but only applied to one path’s blocks, ensuring stable refinement.\n\n---\n\n### **Final answer:**\n\n**The motivation for balancing accuracy and consistency losses during diversification training is to simultaneously ensure that individual model predictions remain accurate with respect to the ground truth while encouraging agreement between different candidate models.

Additionally, the uncertainty map is generated using the standard deviation... This methodology maintains or potentially improves the performance of the given pre-trained model...\n\nAnd from the figure caption:\n\n> The final results for tasks with continuous or discrete data types are determined using median or majority voting methods, respectively...\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe motivation for using the **median** ([mask1]) on the **result pool of multiple predictions** ([mask2]) for fusing continuous predictions is to robustly aggregate multiple continuous outputs by capturing a central tendency that is less sensitive to outliers or extreme values. This improves the reliability and stability of the fused final prediction by reducing the influence of any inaccurate individual model outputs."

During backpropagation, these combined gradients are calculated only for the candidate blocks active in the updated model's path, and only these blocks are updated. The other model remains unchanged.

Vector extraction from the Subject LLM internal info (hidden states).\n  2. Cluster search (automated, adaptive sampling).\n  3. Active sampling, comprising:\n     - **Inter Cluster Sample (red box):**  \n       Sampling between clusters using Cluster Variance Estimation.\n     - **Intra Cluster Sample (blue box):**  \n       Sampling within clusters using LLM confidence distribution, external info.\n\n- The **red box area** (Inter Cluster Sample) shows a cluster variance estimation plot and indicates a selection of a specific cluster from which the next intra cluster sample will be drawn.\n\n- The **blue box area** (Intra Cluster Sample) shows a distribution (bar chart) of \"LLM Confidence Distribution\" for the full cluster and newly selected data point, indicating that within-cluster sampling tries to match the confidence distribution of the whole cluster.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Understand the methodology from the context\n\n- **Clustering:**\n\n  Clustering is done based on internal hidden states of LLM — representing similar behaviors/tasks. This partitions the test data into subsets (clusters) where performance is expected to have low variance.\n\n- **Inter-cluster sampling:**\n\n  The goal is to minimize variance in performance estimation by selecting representative points from each cluster. Because variance is unknown upfront, a multi-armed bandit approach (MC-UCB) is used to estimate cluster variance and select clusters with highest uncertainty.\n\n- **Intra-cluster sampling:**\n\n  After selecting a cluster (via inter-cluster sampling), a specific point within that cluster is picked.\n\n  Instead of random sampling, the intra-cluster strategy aims to keep the sample's **confidence distribution** close to the cluster's overall confidence distribution (LLM output confidence) to ensure unbiased, distribution-aware sampling.\n\n  Techniques like Kolmogorov-Smirnov test or Wasserstein distance measure and minimize distribution discrepancy.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Chain of reasoning about how **Inter Cluster Sample** minimizes discrepancy between sampled examples and **Intra Cluster Sample** within clusters?\n\n- The **Inter Cluster Sample** stage selects which cluster to sample from next based on the estimated variance and size of clusters — this guides allocation of labeling budget proportionally to cluster uncertainty.\n\n- After choosing the cluster via inter-cluster sampling, the **Intra Cluster Sample** stage picks specific points that keep the confidence distribution of sampled points matched to the overall cluster confidence distribution.\n\n- Thus, **Inter Cluster Sample** controls the high-level allocation of samples across clusters minimizing overall estimation variance (variance between clusters).\n\n- **Intra Cluster Sample**, guided by LLM confidence distribution (external info), ensures within the selected cluster the samples are representative of the cluster data distribution, minimizing sampling bias within clusters.\n\n- The integration of both ensures that the **sampled examples at the cluster level (inter-cluster)** are representative of the internal state clusters (minimizing estimation variance), and **samples within each cluster (intra-cluster)** reflect the distribution of LLM confidence outputs, thereby minimizing discrepancy between the sampled examples and the overall internal-external behavior of that cluster.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\nThe **Inter Cluster Sample** step minimizes discrepancies by choosing clusters for sampling based on their estimated variance (cluster variance estimation), ensuring sampling resources focus on clusters where performance uncertainty is high. This leads to representative sampling at the cluster level.\n\nWithin those chosen clusters, the **Intra Cluster Sample** step selects data points by minimizing the difference between the confidence distribution of sampled points and the entire cluster (measured via statistical distances like Kolmogorov-Smirnov or Wasserstein). This keeps the distribution of sampled points aligned with the LLM’s output confidence distribution for that cluster.\n\nTogether, this two-level sampling approach ensures the sampled test examples are representative of both the LLM’s internal state structure (clusters) and the external confidence distribution within clusters, minimizing discrepancies between sampled and overall cluster distributions.\n\n---\n\n# **Answer:**\n\nThe **Inter Cluster Sample** minimizes discrepancies between sampled examples and those within clusters by adaptively allocating sampling efforts across clusters based on cluster variance estimation. It identifies which clusters to sample from to reduce overall performance estimation variance. Then, within each selected cluster, the **Intra Cluster Sample** actively selects data points that maintain the confidence distribution of the sample as close as possible to the full cluster’s confidence distribution, thereby minimizing distribution bias. This combination ensures that the sampled examples are representative of the clusters both in terms of internal LLM behavior (via clustering) and external confidence outputs, effectively minimizing discrepancies between sampled points and the true underlying distributions within clusters."

Frame model** within the \"EqNIO\" processing pipeline.\n\n- From the context and caption, this \"Eq. Frame model\" is the equivariant network that predicts the **canonical yaw frame** \\( \\mathbf{F} \\) from gravity-aligned IMU data.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Understand the role of the Eq. Frame model**\n\n- The Eq. Frame model takes in IMU data aligned with gravity but potentially at arbitrary yaw angles.\n\n- Its output is a canonical yaw frame \\( \\mathbf{F} \\) that maps the IMU data into a canonical frame. This canonicalization enables consistent downstream processing, independent of the IMU's orientation around the gravity axis.\n\n- The model ensures that the canonical frame estimate transforms *equivariantly* relative to arbitrary roto-reflections (elements of the group \\( O(2) \\)) in the horizontal plane (perpendicular to gravity).\n\n- Equivariance implies that if the input data is rotated or reflected, the predicted canonical frame rotates/reflected accordingly, preserving geometric consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: How does the Eq. Frame model leverage group equivariant networks?**\n\n- The context formalizes the equivariance constraint on the canonical frame prediction function \\( f \\):  \n  \\[\n  f(O_g \\mathbf{x}) = \\rho(g) f(\\mathbf{x}),\n  \\]  \n  where \\( O_g \\) acts on the input data by a group element \\( g \\in O(2) \\), and \\( \\rho(g) \\) is a matrix representation of the group acting on the frame output.\n\n- \\( f \\) must be equivariant w.r.t. the group \\( O(2) \\) which includes rotations \\( SO(2) \\) and reflections.\n\n- To realize this, they design the Eq. Frame model as an equivariant network using the theoretical framework for \\( O(2) \\) equivariant mappings.\n\n- Specifically, the model uses:\n\n  - **Input decomposition:** separating IMU input features into scalars (invariant under \\( O(2) \\)) and vectors (transforming under irreducible representations of \\( O(2) \\)).\n\n  - **Equivariant linear layers (Eq-L):** which respect the \\( O(2) \\) symmetry by constraining learnable weights such that outputs transform appropriately. For example, for vector features in 2D, linear layers satisfy  \n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{W} = \\rho(g) \\mathbf{W} \\rho(g)^{-1}\n    \\]\n    for all \\( g \\in O(2) \\).\n\n  - **Equivariant convolution layers (Eq-Conv):** 1D convolutions over the time dimension built on Eq-L blocks, maintaining \\( O(2) \\) equivariance.\n\n  - **Equivariant nonlinearities:** specially designed layers that mix scalar and vector features and maintain the equivariance constraint.\n\n- This architecture ensures the output frame \\( \\mathbf{F} \\) predicted by the Eq. Frame model behaves predictably and consistently under all transformations in \\( O(2) \\).\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Benefits and consequences**\n\n- By enforcing \\( O(2) \\)-equivariance, the network learns a frame estimate that is:\n\n  - **Consistent** regardless of initial yaw rotation or reflection of the IMU data.\n\n  - **Stable** due to diagonal covariance parameterization linked to the canonical frame axes.\n\n  - **Generalizable** to any yaw orientation or reflection, improving downstream displacement estimation.\n\n---\n\n### Final succinct answer:\n\n**The Eq. Frame model (highlighted by [mask1]) leverages group equivariant network frameworks by enforcing \\( O(2) \\)-equivariance on the canonical yaw frame estimation function. It processes IMU input features separated into scalars and 2D vectors using equivariant linear and convolutional layers (Eq-L, Eq-Conv) designed to respect the group symmetries (rotations and reflections in the horizontal plane). Equivariant nonlinearities further ensure consistency of transformations. This architecture guarantees that the predicted canonical frame rotates or reflects in a predictable, equivariant manner with respect to the input IMU data's transformations. By doing so, the model learns canonical frames invariant to arbitrary yaw orientations/reflections, stabilizing and generalizing the downstream inertial odometry predictions.**"

The Eq-L and Eq-Conv layers use weight matrices constrained by the group's representations to ensure outputs transform appropriately under rotations and reflections. The nonlinearities modulate vector feature norms using scalar outputs from an MLP applied to concatenated scalar features and vector norms, preserving equivariance. This combined operation enables the network to jointly process scalars and vectors while maintaining equivariance throughout, ensuring that the canonical frame output generalizes across arbitrary roto-reflections as required by the methodology."

For each new frame, its initial pose is computed based on 2D-3D correspondences using PnP, leveraging the previously optimized poses from earlier frames.\n\n3. **How [mask1] influences [mask2]:**  \n   The incremental addition of views ([mask1]) directly impacts PnP pose initialization ([mask2]) by providing:\n\n   - A \"chain\" of posed frames where new frames find correspondences to already optimized previous frames.\n   - More reliable 2D-3D correspondences because the previous frames have refined poses, helping the PnP solve better initial poses for new frames.\n   - Essentially, each newly added frame's initial pose via PnP is computed using information propagated incrementally from the previous frames.\n\n4. **Context confirmation:**  \n   In the text under \"Incremental pose optimization\", the process is described in these terms: \"For each newly added frame \\( I_j \\), we compute 2D correspondences with the previous image \\( I_{j-1} \\), cast rays using optimized pose \\( P_{j-1} \\) to localize 3D points, and then run PnP with RANSAC for the initial pose of \\( I_j \\).\"\n\n   This confirms that adding views incrementally ([mask1]) allows progressively computing the initial poses with PnP ([mask2]) using previous optimized information.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\nAdding views incrementally ([mask1]) enables the PnP pose initialization process ([mask2]) to compute initial poses for new frames more accurately by leveraging 2D-3D correspondences established with previously optimized frames, allowing a step-by-step refinement and initialization of camera poses as more views are incorporated."

        "response": "The [mask1] in the question corresponds to the highlighted area within the red box in the image, which shows the \"Spotting a pose probe in images, cube init.\" step. This refers to the process of initializing the pose probe (the generic object used for camera pose calibration) in the input images by detecting and segmenting it, and initializing its shape as a cube.\n\nFrom the detailed context, the object pose probe is represented and optimized using a Signed Distance Field (SDF) grid. The initial SDF is constructed from a coarse cube mesh shape, and then deformed via a DeformNet that predicts deformations and corrections on the SDF to refine the object's shape.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning about the limitations arising from the SDF grid when deforming complex probe shapes via DeformNet:**\n\n1. **Initial Shape Simplification:**  \n   The SDF grid is initialized as a coarse cube to approximate the pose probe’s shape. This coarse voxel grid acts as a strong prior and reduces the search space, but it inherently limits how much detail can be captured initially.\n\n2. **Limited Resolution of Voxel Grid:**  \n   Explicit voxel grids, including the SDF grid used here, have limited resolution due to memory and computational constraints. This restricts the detail and fidelity achievable in representing complex or highly detailed geometries directly in the voxel grid.\n\n3. **Dependence on DeformNet for Fine Details:**  \n   Because the SDF grid resolution is coarse and non-learnable (fixed), DeformNet (an implicit MLP network) is responsible for predicting smooth deformation vectors and corrections to achieve detailed shapes. While implicit representation is good for smoothness, it may struggle with highly complex topologies or very fine-grained geometric details beyond the capacity of the learned deformation field.\n\n4. **Smoothness and Degeneration Risks:**  \n   The text mentions that using an explicit SDF correction voxel grid to refine the template SDF is straightforward but can limit sharing and promote degeneration, especially under sparse views. Hence, DeformNet's implicit field is preferred but implicitly assumes smooth, continuous deformations which might not capture very sharp or intricate shape features perfectly.\n\n5. **Under-Constrained Problem with Few Views:**  \n   Sparse-view input images provide limited information, which compounds the difficulty of reconstructing complex geometry accurately because the SDF deformation must be inferred from limited data, increasing the risk of inaccuracies or oversimplification.\n\n6. **Learning Scale Parameters per Scene:**  \n   The SDF values are scaled by trainable parameters per scene, but this scaling cannot fully compensate for the limited representational capacity inherent in the coarse SDF voxel grid.\n\n**Summary answer:**  \nThe limitations arising from the SDF grid when deforming complex probe shapes via DeformNet include restricted resolution and expressiveness of the coarse explicit SDF voxel grid, which limits detailed geometric representation. As a result, DeformNet must infer smooth implicit deformations and corrections, which may struggle to capture fine or complex details, especially under sparse-view conditions. This leads to potential oversmoothing and degeneration in shape reconstruction, making the approach most suitable for objects with relatively simple shapes or coarse approximations.\n\n---\n\n### Final concise answer:\n\nThe coarse and fixed-resolution SDF voxel grid used as the template limits detailed geometric representation of complex probe shapes. This restricts the fidelity of shape deformation, as DeformNet must rely on smooth implicit deformations to refine the shape. Consequently, complex or fine-grained details may be smoothed out or inaccurately represented, especially in sparse-view scenarios, leading to potential degeneration and limits on deforming highly complex probe geometries."

Since these common objects ubiquitously present in scenes enable accurate pose estimation and detailed 3D scene reconstruction from sparse and unposed images, they can facilitate covert modeling of private environments without consent.

According to the diagram and the detailed textual context, this module involves using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate **augmented abnormal textual descriptions** based on normal and abnormal texts, which are then encoded by the text encoder of the Vision-Language Model (VLM) to form fine-grained anomaly-related text prompts. These prompts are used for spatial anomaly localization by retrieving spatial patch features corresponding to anomalous events.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning about the biases [mask1] (LLM-based Prompt) might introduce in spatial anomaly localization scenarios:\n\n1. **Nature of LLM-generated abnormal descriptions:**\n\n   - The LLM generates augmented abnormal descriptions using templates such as “Provide phrases similar to [abnormal category].”  \n   - These descriptions rely on the LLM’s training data and its language understanding, which might be biased by the datasets it was trained on or the phrasing patterns it learned.\n\n2. **Biases due to semantic ambiguity and generalization:**\n\n   - The LLM might generate abnormal descriptions that are too general, vague, or semantically overlapping with normal text descriptions, especially since normal behavior can be difficult to accurately summarize in text.  \n   - This could lead to overlapping or ambiguous textual prompts that do not perfectly discriminate between normal and abnormal spatial regions, causing false positives or negatives.\n\n3. **Domain and scenario dependence:**\n\n   - The LLM is likely trained on large-scale general text corpora that may not perfectly align with the domain-specific context of surveillance videos (e.g., industrial, traffic, or crowd settings).  \n   - Hence, the LLM-generated terms might miss subtle anomalies specific to the video domain or generate unrealistic descriptions biased by general knowledge.\n\n4. **Bias from relying on textual analogies:**\n\n   - The abnormal descriptions generated are based on analogical phrases (similar semantics, paraphrasing).  \n   - If these analogies deviate semantically or syntactically from the visual concepts actually present in the video patches, the text-to-image alignment might fail or falsely highlight irrelevant patches.\n\n5. **Potential for missing rare or novel anomalies:**\n\n   - The LLM might tend to produce more common or frequent abnormal phrases it \"knows,\" resulting in failure to cover rare or novel anomalous events.  \n   - This biases the spatial localization to known anomaly types and limits generalizability to unseen anomalies.\n\n6. **Impact on spatial anomaly localization:**\n\n   - Such biases can cause **false alarms**, i.e., background regions falsely classified as anomalous due to imperfect prompt generation.  \n   - There can be **missed detections** where actual anomaly patches are not captured because they do not semantically align well with LLM-generated text prompts.  \n   - Ultimately, these biases reduce the **precision** and **reliability** of spatial anomaly localization using LLM-based prompts.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Answer:\n\nThe **LLM-based prompt** ([mask1]) introduces biases in spatial anomaly localization scenarios by generating augmented abnormal textual descriptions that can be semantically ambiguous, overly general, or domain-mismatched. These biases arise from the LLM’s pretrained knowledge and language generation patterns, potentially causing false alarms, missed detections, and reduced precision in localizing anomalies. Specifically, the LLM may produce abnormal prompts that overlap or conflict with normal descriptions, overlook rare or subtle anomalies, or fail to align perfectly with local visual features, thereby impacting the accuracy and reliability of spatial anomaly localization in weakly supervised video anomaly detection."

For temporal modeling, they introduce a temporal adapter module to model temporal relations beyond simple pooling.\n\n4. **Potential alternatives to Top-K for robust variable-length temporal anomaly detection:**  \n   - **Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) techniques:** Instead of Top-K, MIL frameworks weigh contributions from multiple frames, possibly using soft attention mechanisms rather than hard top-k selection.  \n   - **Temporal attention mechanisms:** Learning frame-level importance weights for aggregation helps focus on anomalous frames adaptively, often via attention layers or transformers.  \n   - **Temporal pooling variants:** Average pooling, max pooling, or learned pooling layers could also aggregate over time with different robustness to noise.  \n   - **Temporal coherence or continuity modeling:** Using temporal adapters or recurrent networks to incorporate temporal dynamics, not just relying on selecting highest scoring frames.  \n   - **Contrastive or consistency losses over temporal windows:** To better distinguish anomalies over temporal contexts.\n\n5. **Why alternatives might enhance robustness?**  \n   Because fixed Top-K selection assumes the highest-scoring frames correspond to true anomalies, which may not hold if false positives have high scores or anomalies have subtle temporal extents. Adaptive temporal attention or MIL with learned instance weights can improve robustness in variable-length videos by better contextualizing anomaly scores over time.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n**Alternative mechanisms to the Top-K operation ([mask1]) that could enhance robustness in variable-length anomaly detection include:**\n\n- Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)-based aggregation methods such as MIL-Align, which use soft instance weighting rather than hard-top selection.  \n- Temporal attention mechanisms that learn adaptive weights over frames, enabling better focus on anomalous frames across time.  \n- Temporal adapters or transformer-based temporal modeling that capture temporal dependencies and provide context-aware anomaly scores.  \n- Different temporal pooling strategies (mean, max, learned pooling) that balance sensitivity and noise robustness.  \n- Incorporating temporal coherence and contrastive learning objectives to enhance temporal feature consistency.\n\nThese alternatives can complement or replace the Top-K mechanism to yield more robust temporal anomaly detection under varying video lengths and anomaly patterns."

Dual-branch prompt learning** and **3.2.4 Objective function**:\n\n- The **Binary Classifier** (red box) corresponds to the **classification branch (C-Branch)**:\n  - It takes spatio-temporally enhanced frame features and outputs **frame-level anomaly confidence scores**.\n  - These per-frame anomaly scores are aggregated via a **TopK mechanism** to generate a **video-level binary anomaly label** (whether the video contains anomaly or not).\n  - The objective function here is a binary cross-entropy loss based on video-level binary labels.\n\n- The **MIL-Align** (blue box) corresponds to the **alignment branch (A-Branch)**:\n  - It computes the **anomaly category probabilities** by aligning image features with textual label embeddings (i.e., image-to-concept alignment).\n  - Uses **Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)** via MIL-Align to compute the video-level classification scores for each abnormal category (i.e., which class of anomaly).\n  - This branch uses the video-level class label for the loss calculation.\n  \nThus, these two branches produce **complementary outputs**:\n- The classification branch outputs a binary anomaly confidence (anomaly present or not).\n- The alignment branch outputs anomaly class probabilities (which category of anomaly).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: How do they combine to achieve video-level labelling?\n\nThe diagram and text describe they **combine the outputs of these two branches (binary confidence scores from classification and category probabilities from alignment) to generate accurate video-level labels**.\n\nFrom the text:\n\n> \"With  and  in hands, we adopt the typical TopK (for classification branch) and MIL-Align (for alignment branch) strategies to compute the video-level anomaly prediction and category prediction, respectively, these predictions are subsequently used to calculate losses and provide data support for model optimization.\"\n\nFurther:\n\n> \"No matter how the spatial region of abnormal events changes, these two features, i.e.,  and , can extract key abnormal information from the local and global perspectives. In other words, they are complementary.\"\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Infer the advantage of combining the [mask1] output with the [mask2] alignment\n\n- The **binary classifier (mask1)** focuses on **temporal anomaly detection**, providing a robust measure of whether there's an anomaly in terms of temporal occurrence (frame-level anomaly confidence).\n\n- The **MIL-Align alignment branch (mask2)** focuses on **spatial and category-level anomaly recognition**, aligning visual features with semantic text concepts to recognize the anomaly's category.\n\n- Combining the two leverages **both a direct binary anomaly confidence and a category-aware alignment-based confidence**, leading to more discriminative and accurate video-level labeling because:\n\n  - Classification branch helps to ensure anomalies are detected in a coarse temporal manner.\n  \n  - Alignment branch refines by considering the semantic category alignment, providing richer supervision without spatial annotations.\n  \n  - The combination improves optimization by jointly using binary anomaly presence and category information.\n\n- Therefore, this dual-branch combination improves both **accuracy and robustness** of video-level labels for weakly supervised spatio-temporal anomaly detection.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nThe advantage of combining the **binary classifier output ([mask1])** with the **MIL-Align alignment ([mask2])** is that it enables the model to leverage complementary information: the binary classifier provides a robust temporal anomaly confidence for video-level anomaly presence, while the MIL-Align alignment branch provides semantic, category-level anomaly probabilities through image-to-concept alignment. This dual-branch integration improves video-level labeling accuracy and robustness by jointly exploiting temporal anomaly detection and semantic category alignment, enabling effective model optimization without requiring detailed spatio-temporal annotations."

Instead of summing the sample counts across components, it samples from the joint space with the number of samples equal to the largest sampling set size among the components. This avoids redundant sampling and reduces the total number of samples needed from |X₁ᴾ| + |X₂ᴾ| in independent sampling to max(|X₁ᴾ|, |X₂ᴾ|) in synchronous sampling.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Independent: total samples = sum of components’ sample sizes.\n- Synchronous: total samples = maximum of components’ sample sizes.\n- Thus, synchronous sampling [mask1] reduces total sample complexity by leveraging the exclusive (disjoint) scopes and joint sampling."

This module uses several Multi-scale Transformer Blocks (MTBs) arranged in a top-down manner along with concatenations to process multi-level encoder features and generate global features \\( G \\).\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Contextual Location and Function:**\n   - The red box encloses the Global Perception Module (GPM), which is responsible for capturing long-range dependencies and contextual relationships among pixels at multiple scales.\n   - It is positioned between the encoder features \\( E_i \\) and the decoder features.\n\n2. **How MTB Coordinates Scale-specific Self-attention Maps:**\n   - The MTB within the GPM is specially designed to handle multi-scale self-attention and multi-scale feed-forward networks.\n   - MTB projects the input feature \\( \\mathbf{Z} \\) into three differently scaled feature spaces (\\( Z_3, Z_5, Z_7 \\)) using depthwise convolution with kernel sizes 3, 5, and 7, respectively.\n   - This multi-scale projection allows the generation of multiple scale-specific self-attention maps (\\( A_3, A_5, A_7 \\)) by performing dot-product interactions of these scaled projections.\n\n3. **Maintaining Consistent Semantic Context:**\n   - The multi-scale self-attention maps capture relationships at different spatial scales but refer to the same input feature space, which enriches the contextual diversity.\n   - The multiple scale-specific attention maps are concatenated and fused by convolutional layers into a unified feature representation that integrates information from all scales.\n   - Layer normalization and residual connections maintain stability and help preserve semantic consistency.\n\n4. **Information Flow in the GPM:**\n   - Features flow top-down through four MTB units, where each MTB refines the global contextual information from high-level features to low-level ones, enhancing global semantic understanding.\n   - Concatenations (denoted by \\( C \\)) link the outputs of MTBs from different encoder layers, ensuring that scale-specific attention maps from multiple feature resolutions are integrated coherently.\n\n5. **Summary:**\n   - The GPM's MTB blocks coordinate scale-specific self-attention maps by:\n     - Mapping features into multiple scales.\n     - Computing scale-specific self-attention maps independently yet referring to the same semantic content.\n     - Aggregating these diverse scale maps by concatenation and convolutions.\n     - Using top-down connections and residual links to maintain semantic consistency across scales.\n   - This multi-scale attention fusion maintains a consistent semantic context by simultaneously leveraging multiple receptive fields and ensuring complementary information is merged effectively.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nThe **Global Perception Module (GPM)** (highlighted by the red box) coordinates scale-specific self-attention maps through its Multi-scale Transformer Blocks (MTBs) by projecting input features into multiple scale spaces (via convolutions with kernel sizes 3, 5, and 7). It computes independent self-attention maps at each scale, capturing diverse receptive fields and contextual dependencies. These scale-specific attention maps are then activated, concatenated, and fused through convolutional layers and residual connections in a top-down manner. This process enriches the feature representation with multi-scale global semantic information while maintaining consistent semantic context by integrating these scale-dependent maps coherently, allowing the model to effectively understand camouflaged objects across varying shapes and scales."

Group-wise hybrid interaction module (GHIM) (used later to fuse features, but not the main focus here)\n\n- The **GPM** uses Multi-scale Transformer Blocks (MTB) to model **long-range dependencies** (global relationships) across all pixels at different scales.\n- The **LRM** uses Progressive Convolution Blocks (PCB) to capture local receptive field information and **local spatial details** step-wise.\n\nThus, the two modules have complementary roles:  \n- GPM → captures **global semantic, long-range relationships** using transformer-based multi-scale self-attention features.  \n- LRM → captures **local spatial details** via convolution-based progressive processing.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: How does GPM (red box) optimize global relationships?\n\n- GPM uses a top-down structure of four consecutive MTBs with multi-scale self-attention to capture pixel relationships at multiple scales (3x3, 5x5, 7x7 kernels via depth-wise convs) to extract **rich context and global semantic information** across the entire image.\n\n- It uses:\n  - Layer Normalization,\n  - Multi-scale attention projections and multi-scale feed-forward networks (FFN) with gating and GELU non-linearity,\n  - Residual connections,\n\nto output a global feature with abundant global contexts (`G5, G4, G3, G2`).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: How does LRM (blue box) optimize local details?\n\n- LRM operates similarly on the same encoder features as GPM but focuses on **local refinement**:\n\n- Two stages of Progressive Convolution Blocks (PCB):  \n  - First stage: Atrous convolutions with varying dilation rates (3, 5, 7) followed by 1x1 convs to extract local spatial features at multiple receptive fields → combined progressively → output intermediate local feature.  \n  - Second stage: Depth-wise convolutions with different kernel sizes + 1x1 convs → further capture fine local patterns and spatial details → combined progressively → output final local features (`L5, L4, L3, L2`).\n\n- Residual connections maintain gradient flow and refine local details.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Collaborative optimization in COS\n\n- Both modules work **simultaneously** on initial encoder features to extract complementary information:  \n  - GPM for **global context and long-range dependencies**,  \n  - LRM for **local spatial details**.\n\n- The outputs from GPM and LRM (`G_i` and `L_i`) represent global and local features at corresponding scales.\n\n- Subsequently, the **Group-wise Hybrid Interaction Module (GHIM)** fuses these features, but the question only asks how GPM and LRM collaboratively optimize.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\nThe **Global perception module (GPM)** ([mask1]) and the **Local refinement module (LRM)** ([mask2]) collectively optimize the features in the Collaborative Optimization Strategy (COS) by addressing different aspects of the feature representation:\n\n- The **GPM** utilizes Multi-scale Transformer Blocks (MTB) to model **long-range dependencies** across all pixels using multi-scale self-attention and feed-forward networks. This captures diverse contextual information and global semantic relationships that are critical for identifying camouflaged objects at varying scales as a whole.\n\n- The **LRM**, in contrast, employs Progressive Convolution Blocks (PCB) with atrous and depth-wise convolutions to extract **local spatial details** progressively at multiple dilation rates and kernel sizes. This enhances the representation of fine-grained local patterns and multi-source local information.\n\nTogether, these two modules work in tandem to optimize feature representations such that global relationships and local details are simultaneously enhanced. This complementary design alleviates the limitations of relying solely on either global or local feature extraction, resulting in discriminative and robust features for camouflaged object detection.\n\n---\n\n# **Final concise answer:**\n\nThe **Global perception module (GPM)** ([mask1]) optimizes global relationships by employing Multi-scale Transformer Blocks (MTB) that capture long-range dependencies through multi-scale self-attention and feed-forward networks, providing rich global context and semantic features. Simultaneously, the **Local refinement module (LRM)** ([mask2]) progressively extracts local spatial details via atrous and depth-wise convolutions in Progressive Convolution Blocks (PCB), enhancing fine-grained local information. Together, these modules collaboratively optimize the features in COS by complementarily capturing global semantic relationships and local spatial details, enabling effective and discriminative feature representation for camouflaged object segmentation."

The process regenerates the report if this condition is unmet, ensuring high fidelity and strict control over content.\n\n- **Why this is different:**  \n  Previous report generation methods often generate synthetic reports without explicit control over clinical entities or their distribution, often reproducing the natural but long-tailed and noisy distribution seen in real datasets. This can lead to an imbalance and poor downstream model performance.\n\n- In contrast, this method:  \n  1. Controls the **sampling frequency of clinical entities**, maintaining a **balanced distribution** across entity types, preventing the long-tailed problem.  \n  2.

Unlike previous report generation methods which often reproduce natural but imbalanced and noisy entity distributions, this approach **enforces balanced entity distribution** during sampling, and strictly **validates that generated reports contain exactly these entities via NER-based checks, regenerating as needed to ensure fidelity**. This results in synthetic reports that are both representative and consistent with the clinical entities, effectively addressing long-tailed distributions and improving the quality and diversity of synthetic datasets for Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (MedVLP).\n\n---\n\nThis approach contrasts previous methods that lacked explicit entity-level control, often generating reports with inherited biases and noisy distributions from real datasets, limiting downstream performance. The figure and context clearly show that the key novelty of the [mask1] lies in using clinical entities as controlled prompts combined with validation loops to produce balanced, high-fidelity synthetic reports."

How This Mitigates Long-tailed Distribution Issues Compared to Prior Methods:\n   - Prior methods primarily work with real datasets that inherently have skewed and noisy distributions, which are difficult to fully control and clean.\n   - This approach controls the data distribution at the generation stage, explicitly balancing entity frequencies in synthetic data.\n   - The balancing is implemented via a systematic sampling and filtering process, leveraging entity-level prompts and frequency thresholds.\n   - This results in a dataset that lacks the severe imbalance seen in real-world datasets, removing the long-tailed distribution problem by design.\n   - Furthermore, since the synthetic data is constructed with paired high-fidelity images and text, quality issues and mismatch problems common in real datasets are also mitigated.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\nThe [mask1] strategy (\"Balanced Dataset\") mitigates long-tailed distribution issues by explicitly controlling and equalizing the appearance frequency of different clinical entities during synthetic data generation. Unlike prior balancing methods, which attempt to fix imbalances in noisy, real-world datasets, this approach designs a balanced sampling process at the entity level—using frequency thresholds and entity-type categorization—to generate synthetic reports and paired images with a well-balanced, uniform distribution of clinical concepts. This results in a high-quality, balanced synthetic dataset that avoids the long-tailed distribution problems inherent in real datasets."

Thus, the GMM-based class-conditional prompt sampling directly enables improved semantic alignment and contrastive learning at the class level.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\nThe [mask1] distribution modelling refers to Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) that learn the class-conditional distributions of joint-modal mask embeddings for each semantic class. By sampling class-conditional prompts from these learned GMM distributions, the model generates diverse, semantically informed prompts that condition the transformer decoder to produce class-specific mask predictions. These class-specific masks enable the extraction of disentangled audio feature representations per class via masked average pooling. Consequently, this facilitates class-specific audio-visual feature alignment, allowing the application of dense, class-aware contrastive learning objectives that improve the discriminative power of the learned features and stabilize training. In summary, the GMM distribution modelling informs class-conditional prompt sampling by providing learned probabilistic representations of classes from which effective prompts are sampled, thereby enabling explicit semantic-guided contrastive learning between audio and visual modalities."

Specifically, this module is implemented as a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) that models the class-conditional distribution of the joint-modal mask embeddings.\n\nTo suggest alternatives to this GMM-based distribution modelling approach for enhancing the distribution modelling of class-conditional prompts, we should consider generative or probabilistic models that can effectively capture complex, multimodal, and high-dimensional distributions of embeddings for each class.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Role of [mask1] (Distribution Modelling)**:  \n   The red-boxed module represents the distribution modelling stage, used to generate class-conditional queries by sampling from the estimated distribution of mask embeddings per class. This allows capturing the intra-class variability and improves the representativeness and robustness of class-conditioned prompts.\n\n2. **Current Approach**:  \n   Within the paper, this is implemented using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), which are a classical generative probabilistic model. GMMs provide a parametric way to model the distribution as a mixture of multiple Gaussian components. They are trained via Expectation-Maximization (EM) and maintain a reasonable trade-off between expressiveness and computational simplicity.\n\n3. **Limitations of GMM**:  \n   - GMMs assume Gaussian components; real embedding distributions might be more complex, non-Gaussian, or lie on manifolds.  \n   - Covariance estimation in high-dimensional spaces can be unstable or computationally expensive.  \n   - Limited capacity to model highly non-linear or multimodal feature distributions beyond Gaussian mixtures.\n\n4. **Possible Alternative Models for Distribution Modelling**:  \n   Based on the goal of modelling complex class-conditional distributions of latent embeddings, alternatives could include:\n\n   - **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**:  \n     VAEs can learn probabilistic latent spaces and model complex distributions by encoding and decoding embeddings. They learn nonlinear mappings and can sample diverse class-conditional prompts by conditioning the decoder on class labels.\n\n   - **Normalizing Flows (NFs)**:  \n     NFs provide exact likelihood modeling with invertible transformations, enabling highly expressive distribution modelling that can capture complex multimodal distributions. Conditional normalizing flows can be used for class-conditioned prompt generation.\n\n   - **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**:  \n     Conditional GANs can generate class-conditional embeddings by adversarial training, learning complex distributions without explicit likelihood estimation.\n\n   - **Mixture Density Networks (MDNs)**:  \n     MDNs combine neural networks with mixture models to predict parameters of mixture distributions conditioned on inputs, allowing flexible class-conditional modelling.\n\n   - **Gaussian Processes (GPs)**:  \n     Although computationally intensive, GPs can infer distributions over functions and might serve for distribution modelling if adapted.\n\n   - **Deep Embedding Clustering or Prototype Learning**:  \n     Alternatively, instead of generative modelling, learned prototypes or clusters in embedding space for each class could be sampled to generate class-conditional prompts, possibly learned via deep metric learning.\n\n5. **Practicality and Integration**:  \n   Each alternative has different computational and optimization trade-offs. For AVS tasks with transformer architectures, generative models like VAEs or conditional flows may offer greater flexibility and modelling power than GMMs, potentially leading to richer and more diverse prompt sets for stable bipartite matching and improved cross-modal attention.\n\n**Summary of Suggested Alternatives**:\n\n- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)  \n- Conditional Normalizing Flows (NFs)  \n- Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)  \n- Mixture Density Networks (MDNs)  \n- Prototype learning or deep clustering based methods  \n- Gaussian Processes (less common in this use case due to scalability)\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\nAlternatives to the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for enhancing distribution modelling of class-conditional prompts ([mask1]) include using more expressive generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Conditional Normalizing Flows (NFs), Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Mixture Density Networks (MDNs), or prototype learning methods based on deep embedding clustering.

        "response": "The question asks about the potential limitations of bypassing the component marked as [mask1] in the image, which corresponds to the \"Bipartite Matching to GT\" module highlighted by the red box in the \"Transformer-based Method\" section of Figure 1.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand what [mask1] is:**\n\n   - [mask1] is the \"Bipartite Matching to GT\" module.\n   - This module performs label assignment based on optimal matching (Hungarian algorithm) between predicted mask queries and ground truth (GT).\n   - In the conventional transformer-based method (top-right block in Fig.1), bipartite matching is essential for training to assign queries to GT objects.\n\n2. **What does the paper propose about this bipartite matching?**\n\n   - The authors' approach in their CPM (bottom large block in Fig.1) explicitly seeks to **bypass the bipartite matching process** for class-conditional queries, replacing it with a fixed GT assignment.\n   - Bypassing implies that instead of searching for the optimal matching dynamically during training, **the class-conditional queries get fixed assignments based on class labels sampled from their generative model (GMM).**\n\n3. **Why was there a need to bypass bipartite matching?**\n\n   - From the text (Introduction and method sections), bipartite matching is **unstable and introduces training instability** especially in audio-visual segmentation (AVS) where audio features are noisy and less informative.\n   - Bipartite matching is class-agnostic (queries do not inherently have class guidance), which causes **unstable assignment and slow convergence**.\n   - The authors argue that fixed GT assignment with class-conditional prompts can improve stability and cross-modal alignment.\n\n4. **Potential Limitations of bypassing bipartite matching via fixed GT assignment:**\n\n   While CPM shows improved stability, the surrounding discussion and general understanding of bipartite matching suggest some limitations when bypassing it:\n\n   - **Reduced flexibility in assignment:**\n     - Bipartite matching dynamically assigns queries to GT instances, adapting to visual and audio cues per sample.\n     - Fixed assignment assumes one-to-one correspondence, which may be too rigid for complex or ambiguous cases.\n     - This rigidity can limit the model's ability to handle variation in the number and spatial configurations of objects.\n\n   - **Sensitivity to errors in the generative model:**\n     - The class-conditional queries are sampled from a learned GMM representing class-specific embeddings.\n     - If the model or GMM is not well estimated or representative, the fixed assignments can lead to poor supervision signals.\n\n   - **Poor handling of novel or unseen data variations:**\n     - Dynamic bipartite matching can accommodate new or unexpected object layouts more flexibly.\n     - Fixed GT assignment may struggle if the prompts or class-conditional queries do not generalize well to these scenarios.\n\n   - **Risk of propagating early mistakes:**\n     - Because fixed GT assignments lack the iterative refinement of bipartite matching, initial errors or mismatches can be harder to correct throughout training.\n\n5. **Supporting evidence from the paper:**\n\n   - The \"Limitations and future work\" paragraph notes acoustic semantic weakness and potential stereo audio encoding problems but does not explicitly discuss drawbacks of fixed GT assignment.\n   - However, the notion of improving \"stability\" of bipartite matching suggests that the original bipartite matching leads to \"unstable assignment\" (seen as a problem).\n   - Bypassing it with a fixed assignment improves stability but possibly at the cost of **losing adaptability and dynamic assignment advantages.**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBypassing the \"Bipartite Matching to GT\" module with fixed ground-truth (GT) assignment potentially introduces limitations such as reduced flexibility in matching predicted queries to ground-truth objects, making the training process less adaptive to variations in object number and spatial arrangement. This rigid assignment relies heavily on the accuracy of the generative model for class-conditional queries; if the model or prompts are not representative, it can lead to poor supervision and difficulty in accommodating novel or ambiguous instances. Additionally, fixed assignment may propagate initial errors through training without the capability for iterative refinement that bipartite matching provides, possibly limiting the model's performance in complex or diverse scenarios."

This mechanism aims to enhance filtering when the prompt is unsafe and relax it when safe.\n\n2. **Adaptive Latent Re-attention** operates on the visual latent space during denoising by modifying latent features in the Fourier domain, especially attenuating low-frequency components associated with filtered (unsafe) concepts while preserving others.\n\n3. Both methods jointly filter unsafe content but across different spaces: embedding space (text tokens) and latent feature space (visual features).\n\n4. **Potential error reinforcement:**\n   - If Self-Validating Filtering incorrectly identifies a safe token as toxic, it will project it away from the toxic subspace and increase filtering strength. This may cause **distorted or degraded conditioning input** for the diffusion model.\n   - Meanwhile, Adaptive Latent Re-attention depends on these filtered embeddings to determine which visual features to suppress. If the filtered embeddings are erroneously shifted, the attention may incorrectly diminish **safe visual features**, mistaking them for unsafe content.\n   - Conversely, if Adaptive Latent Re-attention overly suppresses certain visual latent regions due to misalignments in the filtered embeddings, this may feedback implicitly during denoising, causing the model to produce outputs that appear unsafe or distorted, confusing the Self-Validating Filtering's estimation of prompt safety.\n   \n5. Thus, errors in identifying or projecting toxic tokens in the embedding space can misguide the latent re-attention module to incorrectly suppress or preserve certain visual features, and vice versa.\n\n6. This feedback loop between the two components can **reinforce** each other's errors:\n   - An embedding projection error leads to inappropriate latent filtering.\n   - Inappropriate latent filtering produces outputs that conflict with the expected safe content, potentially misleading any dynamic validation mechanism.\n   \n7. While the SAFREE framework is designed to adapt and self-validate to mitigate such issues, imperfect detection or borderline cases in token toxicity and latent feature association remain a possibility for mutual error amplification.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nSelf-Validating Filtering and Adaptive Latent Re-attention can reinforce each other's errors because an incorrect filtering decision in the text embedding space (by projecting tokens incorrectly) can cause the latent re-attention mechanism to suppress or preserve visual features erroneously. This, in turn, affects the diffusion output consistency and might mislead the validation filtering step, creating a feedback loop where errors in one domain lead to errors in the other, potentially degrading the overall filtering effectiveness."

This method effectively removes the token's influence but disrupts the sentence structure and shifts the embedding outside the original input space, which leads to degraded output quality.\n\n- **Random Token Replacement:**  \n  Substituting toxic token embeddings with random safe tokens could be another approach, but this tends to harm coherence and generation quality because it arbitrarily changes the semantic content.\n\n- **Closed-Form Weight Editing or Model Projection Techniques:**  \n  Methods like UCE or RECE perform weight modifications or attention-editing in closed-form solutions to remove harmful content. These, however, involve model editing rather than just input embedding transformations and may not be suitable as direct replacements for the orthogonal projection step.\n\n- **Negative Prompting or Classifier-Free Guidance Adjustments:**  \n  Instead of projections, adding negatively weighted prompts to steer generation away from toxic concepts could be an alternative, but this is more about influencing the generation process than modifying token embeddings.\n\n### Summary:  \nThe key alternative projection strategies discussed or alluded to in the text for toxic concept mitigation besides the proposed **selective orthogonal projection** are:\n\n- **Null embedding replacement** (projecting token embeddings to zero/null vector)  \n- **Direct token removal or replacement with unrelated tokens**  \n- Potentially **closed-form model attention or weight edits**, though these modify model weights rather than just embeddings.  \n\nAmong these, the context strongly emphasizes the superiority of orthogonal projection over null embedding insertion or direct token removal because it better preserves prompt coherence and generation quality.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nAlternative projection strategies that could replace the selective orthogonal projection for toxic concept subspace mitigation include replacing toxic token embeddings with null (zero) embeddings or direct token removal/replacement. However, these approaches tend to degrade generation quality by disrupting prompt coherence and shifting embeddings outside the input space. Other non-embedding projection alternatives involve closed-form model weight or attention edits but modify the model rather than just the input embeddings."

The box includes:\n  - Patch embeddings\n  - Mini-patch embedding / Transformer block\n  - Gram matrix computations at two scales\n  - MLPs that process the Gram matrices' vectors\n  - Concatenation of two embeddings into a weather feature vector **E**\n  \n- **Blue Box ([mask2])**: Encompasses the \"Weather Type Aware Transformer Blocks\" in the encoder and the \"Transformer Decoder\" in Fig. 2(b) and (c):\n  - It shows Transformer blocks enhanced with intra-patch transformers and multiple HyperMLPs\n  - HyperMLPs are fed with the weather feature vector **E**\n  - The vector **E** influences attention, MLP layers, depthwise convolutions, and channel-wise feature modulation inside the encoder-decoder network\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Understand textual reasoning about each component\n\n**From the context:**\n\n- The red box ([mask1]) is the **feature extraction network** that:  \n  - Learns weather-aware features as embeddings describing weather degradations.  \n  - It uses Gram matrices (style representations) applied on transformer features to represent weather-related style (not artistic).  \n  - Uses MLPs on Gram matrices to generate a compact embedding vector **E** for weather feature.  \n  - Contrastive learning is employed to ensure this embedding clusters images by weather type (same weather close, different weather far).  \n  - The extracted weather feature vector **E** encodes the weather degradation characteristics from the input image.\n\n- The blue box ([mask2]) is the **image restoration backbone network** (Transformer encoder-decoder) that:  \n  - Is conditioned and adaptively modulated by the weather feature vector **E** extracted from [mask1].  \n  - The weather vector **E** injects adaptivity spatially (local convolutions), globally (self-attention projections), and channel-wise modulation to tailor the restoration to the specific weather degradation.  \n  - This enables the main restoration network to process the image adaptively, handling multiple weather types with a single unified model.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Reasoning about why combining [mask1] and [mask2]\n\n- The **red box [mask1]** extracts **abstract weather-specific features** representing the type/style of degradation in the input image, but not the image content itself.\n- The **blue box [mask2]** performs **image restoration**, but requires knowledge of the weather conditions to adapt its processing (filters, attention maps, channel importance).\n- Combining these ensures **weather-aware feature extraction**:  \n  - Extract weather type/style embeddings ([mask1]) first,  \n  - Then use the embeddings to condition the restoration network ([mask2]) adaptively.  \n\n- Such combination overcomes the traditional difficulties of single-model multi-weather restoration:  \n  - It explicitly disentangles weather-type features (style) from content.  \n  - Enables the main network to dynamically adjust its parameters to the degradation at hand, improving restoration quality and flexibility.\n\n- Without [mask1], the main network would be \"blind\" to weather type and have to generalize blindly.  \n- Without [mask2], the extracted features would have no effect on restoration.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Final summary answer\n\nThe reasoning behind combining **the feature extraction network ([mask1]) and the weather-aware Transformer-based restoration network ([mask2])** is that:\n\n- The feature extraction network learns compact, discriminative weather-type embeddings from input degraded images, explicitly capturing the degradation style information.\n- These embeddings then guide (\"condition\") the restoration Transformer blocks by modulating their weight parameters, attention mechanisms, convolutional filters, and channel features, thereby enabling the main network to adaptively restore images affected by different types of weather degradations.\n- This design effectively decouples weather-related style features from image content and imparts degradation-specific adaptivity to the restoration model, leading to better multi-weather restoration performance within a unified framework.\n\n---\n\n### **Answer:**\n\nThe combination of [mask1] (the feature extraction network) and [mask2] (the Transformer-based restoration backbone) is grounded in the reasoning that multi-weather image restoration requires explicit modeling of different weather degradation types as distinct \"styles.\" The feature extraction network ([mask1]) extracts compact, discriminative weather-aware embeddings by processing correlations in transformer feature maps via Gram matrices and projection MLPs, and is trained with contrastive learning to cluster similar weather types. These embeddings capture the style of the weather degradation independently of the image content.\n\nThe restoration backbone ([mask2]) is then guided by these embeddings to adaptively modulate its parameters spatially (via depthwise convolution), globally (via self-attention projections), and along the channel dimension (via affine feature modulation). This modulation tailors the network's processing to the specific weather degradation present in the input image. Thus, combining [mask1] and [mask2] enables weather-aware feature extraction that informs and guides the image restoration network to perform adaptive, multi-weather restoration effectively within a unified model."

III-C), the key points are:\n\n- **Motivation for Spatially Local Adaptivity:**\n\n  - Transformer architectures generally lack inductive biases that express **local pixel interactions** because attention operates globally.\n  - Local spatial context is important for certain weather degradations; for example:\n    - **Deraining** mainly requires **local contexts** to detect and remove rain streaks.\n    - Other degradations (e.g., snow removal) may demand more global understanding.\n    \n- **Inclusion of Depthwise Convolution:**\n\n  - To encode such local spatial interactions, a **depthwise convolution layer** is added between the two MLP layers in each feed-forward network of the Transformer block.\n  \n- **Generating Depthwise Conv Kernels via HyperMLP:**\n\n  - Unlike using fixed kernels, the depthwise convolution parameters are **dynamically generated conditioned on the weather type features**.\n  - The weather-dependent feature vector **z** is extracted by a feature extraction hyper-network.\n  - This vector **z** is fed into a small MLP (named HyperMLP in the diagram) to produce the parameters (weights) of the depthwise convolution kernels.\n  - Consequently, **different weather types generate different depthwise convolution kernels**, allowing the network to adapt its local filters depending on the input degradation.\n  \n- **Benefits:**\n\n  - This conditional kernel generation enables the model to have **spatially local adaptivity** tuned to the weather-specific degradations.\n  - It allows more precise, weather-aware local processing, better than fixed convolution filters.\n  \n---\n\n**Step 3: Summarize the rationale**\n\n- Because vanilla Transformer blocks lack local inductive biases, a depthwise convolution layer is added to capture local spatial context.\n- To achieve future adaptivity and dynamic behavior for various weather degradation types, the depthwise convolution kernels are **generated by a hyper-network (HyperMLP)** conditioned on the extracted weather feature vector.\n- This mechanism enables a **locally adaptive treatment of images depending on weather type**, enhancing restoration performance.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe rationale for generating depthwise convolution kernels via HyperMLP is to enable spatially **local adaptivity** in the Transformer blocks. Since vanilla Transformers lack inductive biases for local pixel interactions, adding depthwise convolutions allows modeling local features. By dynamically generating these convolution kernels conditioned on weather feature vectors extracted by the hyper-network, the model adapts its local filtering operations to different weather degradation types, thereby effectively tailoring the restoration process to the unique local characteristics of each weather condition."

Workers train local models and submit updates; validators check these updates' validity; miners compile validated updates into blocks for the blockchain.\n\n2. **Purpose of the Validator**:  \n   Validators receive transactions containing local model updates from workers and verify their validity to protect against malicious or tampered updates that might degrade model performance or introduce attacks.\n\n3. **How Validators Evaluate the Local Model Updates**:  \n   Since validators do not have direct access to the worker's training data or the original similarity measurements (`(Acc, Acc*)` or `(Loss, Loss*)`), they use a proxy evaluation method:\n   - Each validator performs a single epoch of local training on its own dataset using the current global model to get a proxy local update model.\n   - The validator computes the localization accuracy and loss of both this proxy local model and the received local model update on the validator’s test dataset.\n   - Differences in accuracy (`ΔAcc`) or loss ratios (`LLR`) between these are computed.\n\n4. **Validation Criteria**:  \n   - If the accuracy difference exceeds a predefined threshold (`τ`), indicating the received model might be malicious or noisy, the validator casts a **negative vote**.\n   - Otherwise, the validator issues a **positive vote**.\n   - This voting result directly influences whether that particular local model update is accepted or rejected.\n\n5. **Filtering before Miner Processing**:  \n   - Only local models with sufficient positive votes from validators (positive votes ≥ negative votes) are forwarded and consolidated by miners.\n   - Invalid or suspicious models are discarded, and rewards are adjusted accordingly.\n\n**Summary/Answer:**  \nThe [mask1], representing the \"Validator\" mechanism, evaluates and filters local model updates by comparing the update's performance (accuracy and loss) on the validator's test dataset against a proxy local model trained briefly on the same global model. If the difference in validation accuracy or loss ratio exceeds a preset threshold, the validator issues a negative vote; otherwise, it casts a positive vote. This voting process filters out potentially malicious or low-quality local models before they reach the miners for block creation.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\nThe Validator mechanism evaluates local model updates by comparing their localization accuracy and loss on the validator's test dataset against those of a proxy local model trained by the validator itself for one epoch. It calculates accuracy differences and validation loss ratios to detect distortions indicative of malicious alterations. If these metrics exceed preset thresholds, the validator casts a negative vote; otherwise, it casts a positive vote. Only updates with sufficient positive votes are accepted and forwarded to miners for blockchain inclusion, effectively filtering out malicious or poor-quality local models before mining."

The aggregation process happens on the blockchain, which is decentralized, immutable, and traceable.\n\nStep 3: How Miner aggregation improves security compared to centralized server.\n\n- **Decentralization**: Miner nodes collectively perform aggregation, eliminating the single-point failure risk of centralized aggregation.\n\n- **Use of blockchain:** Aggregation results and votes are stored on blockchain, ensuring immutability and traceability so malicious activity can be detected and prevented.\n\n- **Validation Mechanism:** Before miners aggregate local models, validators verify each update's quality and vote to accept or reject.

To improve this, we adjust the frequency weighting function using the absolute value of the logarithm of the spectrum distance. This adjustment increases the weight for lower scale distances. The frequency distance between reference points in image pairs is defined in Euclidean space at spectral position (u,v) as the frequency distance matrix F. Here, μ serves as a control factor to adjust changes in each section. Similar to FFL, we normalize the weight matrix by dividing F by its maximum value Fmax, and refer to it as F̂ from now on.",

This structured dataset construction thus enables direct examination of how these sequence length differences impact the model's editing performance."

Known to cause performance degradation due to norm explosion in edited layers.  \n- Figure 5b and 5c show L1 norm growth in editing layers with ROME (at 100 edits) and MEMIT (at 850 edits). Norm growth leads to model performance decline.  \n- Current sequence editing methods (like MEMIT) accumulate large norm values as edits accumulate, causing forgetting and inefficiency.\n\n- The **Dump for Sequence (D4S) method** (red box, f) is proposed to address this norm growth and performance degradation.  \n- D4S stores concise editing history matrices that allow all past edits to be combined into a single batch operation instead of sequential incremental edits. This reduces space complexity and mitigates norm growth.  \n- Theoretical proof suggests that the D4S update matrix has smaller norm due to properties of positive definite matrices and inverses, reducing norm explosion compared to standard MEMIT.  \n- Experiments (Figure 6 referenced) confirm that D4S reduces L1-norm growth in the editing layers, improving stability over cumulative edits.\n\nStep 4: Summarize how D4S mitigates norm growth compared to standard methods:\n\n- Standard methods like MEMIT accumulate edits sequentially, which causes the norms of the edited parameters to grow explosively over many edits.  \n- D4S integrates all edit history matrices into one combined batch update using matrix addition, requiring only O(d²) storage instead of O(n), where n is number of edits.  \n- This consolidated update suppresses large norm increases by effectively averaging or combining edits mathematically, leading to smaller updates per edit dimension.  \n- The inverse of the combined matrix in D4S results in smaller numerical values, directly reducing parameter norm growth.  \n- Thus, D4S mitigates norm growth better than standard sequence editing approaches and preserves model performance over more edits.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\nThe **Dump for Sequence (D4S)** method mitigates norm growth more effectively than standard sequence editing methods (like MEMIT) by consolidating all past edits into a single combined batch update. Instead of applying edits sequentially, D4S stores and sums two key matrices representing edit history, enabling updates with much lower space complexity and preventing explosive norm increases. Theoretically, because the combined update matrix in D4S involves the inverse of a positive definite sum, its norm is smaller than the product of sequential inverses in standard methods. Experimentally, D4S shows reduced L1-norm growth in the editing layers, thus alleviating parameter norm explosion and improving model stability and editing success across many sequential edits."

While effective, this compression can **jeopardize model interpretability** in the knowledge editing task (highlighted in blue) by obscuring the transparency and traceability of individual edits. This lack of clarity may raise **ethical concerns** since it reduces auditability and accountability of the updated knowledge, potentially allowing the retention or propagation of outdated, biased, or harmful information without clear oversight."

According to the text:  \n  > \"We discretize the space of possible symmetry plane normals by evenly sampling  fixed unit vectors spanning a hemisphere... These hypotheses cover all possible normals.\"  \n  They serve as queries in the symmetry decoder.\n\n- **Symmetry Decoder (Blue box):**  \n  The decoder takes the spatial image features and the symmetry hypotheses to predict whether each hypothesis neighborhood contains a true symmetry plane. It performs classification (presence of symmetry) and regression (correcting the discrete hypothesis to exact normal via quaternion regression).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Related text about discrete sampling and decoder\n\nThe text pertaining to the hypothesis sampling and symmetry decoder functioning includes:\n\n- The hypotheses are fixed discrete vectors, evenly spaced over the hemisphere.\n- Each hypothesis corresponds to a \"small neighborhood\" around the sampled normal.\n- For each hypothesis, classification determines if a ground-truth symmetry plane is present in that neighborhood.\n- For precise orientation, regression corrects the hypothesis normal.\n\nThis design helps cover the space of normal directions uniformly.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Potential limitations from discrete hypotheses in symmetry decoder\n\nFrom the text and the overall design, the following limitations can be reasoned:\n\n1. **Coarse coverage due to discrete sampling:**  \n   Since hypotheses are discretely sampled unit vectors, the decoder initially assumes symmetry plane normals lie near these discrete directions. Even though regression refines this, the initial candidates represent a discretization that might not perfectly cover complex or fine symmetry directions.\n\n2. **Difficulty with complex/diverse geometries:**  \n   For complex object geometries with many or irregular symmetry planes, or planes close together in orientation, discrete coverage might create ambiguities or miss some symmetry planes if they fall outside or near boundaries of hypothesis neighborhoods.\n\n3. **Resolution vs computation trade-off:**  \n   Increasing the number of hypotheses improves resolution but increases computational cost in the decoder.\n\n4. **Single-view ambiguity and occlusion:**  \n   The decoder relies on local features and discrete hypotheses, but depth ambiguity and occlusion can confuse detection, particularly on the back surfaces or fine geometric details.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Confirm from the text about the limitations\n\nThe text specifically mentions that they sample enough hypotheses so that multiple ground truths won't be assigned to the same query, but also:\n\n> \"We discretize the space ... by evenly sampling fixed unit vectors spanning a hemisphere, which serve as symmetry hypotheses. Each hypothesis represents a small neighborhood ... Hence, our hypotheses cover all possible normals.\"\n\nBut it also notes:\n\n> \"A major difficulty in single-image symmetry prediction is the single-view ambiguity ... which makes learning ambiguous, especially under a regression framework.\"\n\nThis is addressed by multi-view diffusion and aggregation (outside the decoder), but points to inherent limitations in relying solely on discrete hypothesis sampling and single-view image features.\n\n---\n\n### Final synthesized answer:\n\n**The limitations arising from discrete Symmetry Hypotheses sampling in the Symmetry Decoder are related to the coarse discretization of the space of possible symmetry plane normals. While the hypotheses span the hemisphere uniformly, this discrete sampling can lead to imprecise initial coverage for complex and diverse object geometries that exhibit multiple or subtle symmetry planes. Although the decoder regressively refines the normals, the discrete nature imposes a resolution limit and potential ambiguity near boundaries of hypothesis neighborhoods. Further, single-view ambiguity and occlusions can make it difficult for the decoder to accurately identify all symmetries solely based on these discrete samples. These limitations motivate the use of multi-view symmetry enhancement to resolve ambiguities and improve robustness.**\n\n---\n\n# **Answer:**\n\nDiscrete sampling of symmetry hypotheses used as inputs to the symmetry decoder limits the precision and coverage of predicted symmetry planes for diverse object geometries. Although these discrete hypotheses uniformly cover the space of possible symmetry plane normals, their fixed nature imposes a coarse discretization that may miss or ambiguously represent multiple or closely oriented symmetry planes in complex objects. This discretization can reduce detection accuracy since the decoder must rely on regressive corrections to refine the hypotheses, which may be challenging in regions where the geometry exhibits subtle or tightly clustered symmetries. Additionally, when combined with single-view image ambiguities such as occlusion and perspective distortion, this discrete sampling can restrict the symmetry decoder’s ability to reliably detect all symmetries, especially for intricate or diverse objects. Hence, discrete symmetry hypothesis sampling introduces limitations in resolution and robustness for the symmetry decoder when handling diverse object geometries."

This addresses *single-view ambiguity* such as occlusions or perspective distortions.\n\n- Aggregation refers to taking the multiple symmetry predictions from different views, rotating them back into the input image coordinate system, and clustering them via k-means clustering to combine and produce a consolidated final symmetry prediction.\n\n- The multi-view diffusion generates multiple synthesized views, thereby providing more complete and less ambiguous perspectives on symmetry.\n\n- Aggregation helps eliminate redundant or noisy predictions and consolidates consistent symmetry hypotheses from multiple views to improve accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: What challenge does this address, particularly for highly occluded views?\n\n- The *single-view ambiguity* problem is particularly severe when parts of the object are occluded in the input image—there is simply not enough information to detect symmetry robustly from a single viewpoint.\n\n- By generating multiple surrounding views with the multi-view diffusion model, more of the object's geometry becomes visible and less ambiguous.\n\n- Running the symmetry detector on these multiple views results in a more comprehensive set of symmetry predictions.\n\n- However, these multi-view predictions can be noisy or inconsistent depending on the quality of synthesized views. Aggregation improves the robustness of the final symmetry prediction by filtering, clustering, and fusing these multiple outputs.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: How could alternative multi-view diffusion strategies improve aggregation accuracy for highly occluded views?\n\n- Alternative strategies in multi-view diffusion could include:\n\n  - Generating more views (increasing diversity) to better cover occluded surfaces  \n  - Improving the quality and consistency of synthesized views to reduce noise and artifacts  \n  - Using different conditioning strategies on the input image or additional context to better capture unseen geometry  \n  - Incorporating uncertainty estimation in the diffusion outputs to weigh predictions differently during aggregation\n\n- These improvements would yield more accurate, less noisy multi-view images.\n\n- Enhanced multi-view images translate to improved symmetry predictions from the feed-forward detector for each view.\n\n- Consequently, when these predictions are aggregated (clustering & rotation into a common coordinate system), the predictions become more consistent and reliable.\n\n- This reduces the likelihood of erroneous symmetry planes caused by occlusion or ambiguous regions, improving overall accuracy in the aggregated symmetry prediction.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Summary / final answer\n\nAlternative multi-view diffusion strategies that generate higher quality, more diverse, or more consistent surrounding views of the object can provide better coverage of occluded object parts. This richer multi-view information enables the feed-forward symmetry detector to produce more accurate and less noisy symmetry predictions for each view. When these improved predictions are aggregated, the clustering process yields a more precise and comprehensive final symmetry prediction. Thus, by enhancing the multi-view diffusion step, the aggregation accuracy is improved especially for highly occluded views where single-view information is insufficient.\n\n---\n\n# **Final Answer:**\n\nAlternative multi-view diffusion strategies that generate higher-quality, more diverse, or more consistent surrounding views can better reveal the occluded parts of an object. This results in more accurate and less noisy symmetry predictions from each synthesized view. Consequently, when these improved multi-view predictions are aggregated, the process produces more precise and reliable symmetry detection, effectively mitigating the ambiguity caused by occlusion in single views."

Since a normal vector and its opposite represent the same plane, sampling over a hemisphere covers all possible normal directions without redundancy. These sampled hypotheses serve as queries in the cross-attention decoder, allowing the model to attend to relevant image features neighborhood-wise, thereby enabling effective classification and regression of symmetry planes.

        "response": "The question asks:  \n**What rationale supports concatenating FCE outputs with original features via [mask1] rather than stacking ConvModule?**\n\n### Step 1: Understand [mask1] in the diagram  \n- The red box highlights a part in the Neck of the YOLOv8 network where the FCE module output is concatenated with the original features at multiple scales (P3, P4, P5 levels with resolutions 80×80, 40×40, 20×20 respectively).  \n- The FCE module processes the P5 feature map first, followed by upsampling and concatenation with lower scale features (P4 then P3).  \n- After concatenation, the feature maps go through ConvModule and C2f modules, then head detection layers.\n\n### Step 2: Understanding what FCE module and concatenation imply  \n- FCE (Feature Channel Enhancement) modules (SE, GC, GE, GCT) are attention or context modules that improve channel-wise feature representation by weighting important channels more.  \n- Concatenation is a feature fusion method that combines features by stacking channels rather than summing or processing sequentially. This preserves the original features alongside the enhanced features.  \n- ConvModule includes Conv2d + BN + SiLU nonlinear activation in series, which refines features but may change them.\n\n### Step 3: Benefits of concatenating FCE output with original features vs. stacking ConvModule  \n- **Concatenation preserves both enhanced and original information:**  \n  By concatenating, the model retains both the raw features and those refined by FCE modules, allowing subsequent layers (ConvModule + C2f) to learn from both simultaneously.  \n- **Avoids losing important information early:**  \n  Sequentially stacking ConvModules might alter or suppress some original features prematurely, whereas concatenation safeguards those features by explicitly keeping them separate at first.  \n- **Better feature fusion especially across scales:**  \n  The architecture uses multi-scale features (P3, P4, P5). Concatenation after FCE preserves each scale's unique characteristics while integrating enhancements, which aids the Path Aggregation Network's goal of feature fusion with minimal loss of spatial or contextual information.  \n- **Improves global and local context:**  \n  Since FCE modules emphasize global context or channel attention, concatenating with original features balances global enhancements with local details.  \n- **Eases gradient flow and model convergence:**  \n  Concatenation can help gradients flow more effectively because original pathways remain intact. This is a principle behind residual connections and other fusion methods.\n\n### Step 4: Corroboration from context  \n- From Section 3 (Proposed Method), M1 integrates FCE modules in Backbone and Neck for global feature extraction.  \n- The paper shows improved model performance (higher mAP@50) by this approach.  \n- This concatenation-centric strategy likely balances computational efficiency and accuracy, as compared to stacking multiple ConvModules which increase complexity and possibly diminish spatial detail.\n\n### **Final Answer:**  \nThe rationale for concatenating FCE module outputs with the original features (as shown in [mask1]) instead of stacking ConvModules is that concatenation preserves both the enhanced and original feature representations, enabling the network to leverage complementary information simultaneously. This fusion approach retains important original details while incorporating channel-wise enhancements from FCE modules, leading to richer, multi-scale feature representations. It avoids early information loss that may occur with sequential ConvModule stacking and facilitates improved gradient flow, thus enhancing the overall model performance and stability in pediatric wrist fracture detection."

Identify [mask1]:  \n   - The red box in the diagram encloses a module labeled \"C2f.\"  \n   - From the figure caption and structure, \"C2f\" is a module used in the YOLOv8 architecture, specifically in the Head or Neck part of the network.\n\n2. Examine the structure of C2f ([mask1]):  \n   - First, the input feature map comes with channel dimension = c_in.  \n   - Then a \"ConvModule\" transforms the input channels to c_out channels.  \n   - After the ConvModule, there is a \"Split\" operation that divides the c_out channels into two halves, each of size 0.5 * c_out.  \n   - The first half (0.5 * c_out) is directly routed forward (indicated by an arrow bypassing the bottlenecks).  \n   - The second half (0.5 * c_out) is passed through a sequence of \"DarknetBottleneck\" layers. There are n such bottlenecks stacked sequentially.  \n     - Each bottleneck processes and maintains the channel size at 0.5 * c_out.  \n   - After the bottlenecks, the output (still 0.5 * c_out) is concatenated with the skip channel (the first half), forming a feature map of size 0.5*(n+2) * c_out (this may be a typo in the figure; logically, it should be 1 * c_out since 0.5*c_out + 0.5*c_out = c_out; possibly the n reflects some internal stacking).  \n   - Finally, a ConvModule is applied to the concatenated features, outputting c_out channels again.\n\n3. Interpretation:  \n   - Essentially, the input feature channels are first projected to c_out channels.  \n   - Then split equally into two halves.  \n   - One half bypasses the bottlenecks directly (like a residual connection).  \n   - The other half goes through a series of DarknetBottleneck blocks (which perform feature transformations).  \n   - The output features from the bottlenecks and the bypassed half are concatenated, aggregating features with different levels of transformation.  \n   - A concluding ConvModule fuses and reduces the concatenated features back to c_out channels.\n\n4. This design allows part of the features to remain relatively intact (direct path) while the other part undergoes transformation (bottlenecks), improving gradient flow and feature representation.\n\n**Final concise answer:**\n\nThe module ([mask1], the C2f block) first projects the input channels to c_out, then splits these channels equally into two halves. One half (0.5 * c_out channels) bypasses the DarknetBottleneck layers directly, while the other half (0.5 * c_out channels) passes through a sequence of n DarknetBottleneck layers. Afterwards, these two halves are concatenated channel-wise before being fused by a final ConvModule. This approach distributes the incoming channels by splitting them equally, transforming one half through bottleneck layers while keeping the other half as a skip connection, and then combining both to enrich the feature representation."

The context mentions that traditional methods rely on \"cross modality alignment\" where embeddings from each modality get aligned or translated into a shared representation space, enabling downstream models to use them jointly.\n2. The \"Cross Modality Alignment / Translation Module\" processes vector embeddings/token representations from each modality to align them semantically or translate one modality's embedding into another, ensuring these heterogeneous data can be integrated effectively for downstream tasks.\n3.

        "qtype": "Literature_Background",
        "response": "Let's break down the question step-by-step with focus on the [mask1] element and relevant context:\n\n**Step 1: Identify [mask1] from the image and context**  \nIn the image, [mask1] is the \"Image Encoder\" highlighted with a red box in the \"Traditional Embedding Methods\" portion (top half). This component takes the image modality input and encodes it into an \"Image Token Representation\" (Image Token Rep.). This token representation is then sent to the cross-modality alignment/translation module to combine with other modality token reps (audio and video) before the downstream task.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the role of Image Encoder token representation**  \nThe Image Encoder produces an embedding space representation (tokens) that captures the semantic content of the image. This is typical in traditional multimodal learning frameworks where each modality is encoded separately, then aligned or fused via a dedicated alignment or translation module.\n\n**Step 3: Contrastive learning and CLIP relationship to image token representations**  \nCLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) is a prior influential method that learns joint embeddings between images and text by contrasting correct image-text pairs against incorrect pairs. The idea is that both image and text representations live in a shared semantic space where similar concepts are close.\n\nThis contrastive learning allows robust alignment by pulling together matching modalities' embeddings and pushing apart non-matching ones. As a result, image token representations acquired by the image encoder in a system like CLIP are highly semantically meaningful and aligned with textual embeddings because contrastive learning explicitly enforces this alignment during training.\n\n**Step 4: How does the Image Encoder token representation integration draw on contrastive learning like CLIP?**  \nIn traditional embedding methods (shown in the figure), each modality encoder—including the Image Encoder—produces token representations independently. The cross-modality alignment/translation module then aligns these embeddings.\n\nContrastive learning like CLIP is a popular technique to train these encoders, especially the Image Encoder, to produce embeddings that can be meaningfully aligned with text embeddings. By using contrastive loss, the image encoder is explicitly trained to bring embeddings of semantically related pairs closer (image and its caption text) and dissimilar pairs farther apart. This helps to form rich, semantically meaningful image tokens that can be aligned with other modalities downstream.\n\nTherefore, the Image Encoder token representation integration builds upon the principles of contrastive learning by obtaining image tokens that are semantically aligned in the embedding space through contrastive training, similar to CLIP's approach. This foundation allows the subsequent cross-modality alignment module to effectively align and integrate different modalities for downstream tasks.\n\n**Summary Answer:**  \nThe [mask1] Image Encoder token representation integration draws on contrastive learning like CLIP by training the image encoder to produce semantically aligned embeddings through contrastive objectives. This contrastive training aligns image token representations with text embeddings in a shared space, facilitating effective cross-modality alignment downstream.\n\n---\n\n**Final concise answer:**  \nThe Image Encoder token representation leverages contrastive learning, as in CLIP, by training the encoder to produce embeddings that align semantically with textual embeddings through contrastive objectives. This enables the image tokens to be integrated effectively with other modalities in a shared latent space during cross-modality alignment."

        "response": "Let's analyze the question and the context carefully step-by-step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand what the [mask1] is referring to in the question\n- Question: \"How does classifier [mask1] via historical dependencies improve efficiency over FedPAC's optimization-based weighting?\"\n- From the question and caption, [mask1] refers to the content highlighted by the **red box** in the image.\n- The red box encloses the formula for aggregation in the diagram:\n  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{|D|} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{K}} |D_i| \\hat{\\theta}_i^{(t)}\n  \\]\n\n  which corresponds to the aggregation step of feature extractors (θ), where weighted averaging by dataset sizes is done.\n\n- However, in this figure and explained in the context, there is classifier aggregation performed in two ways:\n  - During CCP by MDS (max difference segmentation),\n  - After CCP, by **historical peer matching based aggregation** using the dependency map \\(\\mathcal{G}\\), which records how often a client selects others as relevant peers.\n\n- The question focuses on **how classifier aggregation via historical dependencies** (using the dependency map \\(\\mathcal{G}\\), step (8) in the diagram) improves efficiency compared to **FedPAC's optimization-based weighting**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: What is FedPAC's optimization-based weighting? (From context)\n- FedPAC computes **optimal combination weights** for classifiers from different clients by solving a complex optimization problem (Section: Exploiting inter-client classifier collaboration).\n- This process requires significant computational resources and prolongs the training time.\n- FedPAC can show suboptimal performance with sparse or homogeneous data due to complexity and possibly unstable or inefficient weighting.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: How does the historical dependencies based classifier aggregation work in FedReMa?\n- After the critical co-learning period (CCP), when similarity-based client relevance (from logits) is no longer reliable,\n- The server uses the **historical dependency map \\(\\mathcal{G}\\)**, which counts how many times each client has selected each other client as relevant peers during CCP,\n- This map essentially acts as a **weight matrix** containing the strength of historical client-to-client dependencies,\n- Classifier aggregation then uses these historical weights directly (Equation 10 in the paper) for collaboration, **without solving any optimization**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Benefits of historical dependency based aggregation over FedPAC’s weighting\n1. **Computational efficiency:**  \n   - FedReMa only needs to maintain and update counting statistics (historical selections) during CCP.\n   - No complex optimization problem solving is required after CCP.\n   - This reduces computational overhead and training time significantly.\n\n2. **Simplicity and stability:**  \n   - The historical dependency values are easier to compute and use directly.\n   - The method leverages accumulated knowledge about inter-client relevance over past rounds,\n   - Avoids noisy or unstable weight estimation based on current model parameters/features/logits that can fluctuate especially after CCP.\n\n3. **Adaptation to training phases:**  \n   - During CCP, similarity-based matching is done to identify relevant peers.\n   - After CCP, when classifier models are mature, historical dependency is a better proxy for relevance,\n   - This adaptive approach maintains personalization and generalization.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Final reasoning and answer summary\nClassifier aggregation via **historical dependencies** (in FedReMa) improves efficiency compared to FedPAC's optimization-based weights because:\n\n- It eliminates the need for solving complex optimization problems every round, which FedPAC requires.\n- Instead, it leverages the historical counts of client dependencies established during the critical co-learning period, reducing computational cost.\n- This lightweight method speeds up training while retaining personalized model quality, making it more practical especially in scenarios with sparse or homogeneous data.\n\n---\n\n## Final answer:\n\nClassifier aggregation via historical dependencies improves efficiency over FedPAC's optimization-based weighting by replacing costly optimization computations with a lightweight approach that leverages the accumulated historical dependency map, which records the frequency of client-to-client relevance established during the critical co-learning period. This method uses simple weighted aggregation based on these historical counts rather than solving complex optimization problems repeatedly, thus significantly reducing computational overhead and training time while maintaining personalization and model performance."

If the MDS algorithm continues to be applied, there will be degradation in accuracy. Another way to effectively aggregate the classifiers must be used.\"\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Understand what “Client selection by MDS” means\n\n- MDS = Maximum Difference Segmentation algorithm.\n- It is used to find relevant peers for each client by segmenting based on the maximum difference in similarity scores among classifiers.\n- This helps in client selection for classifier collaboration.\n- The MDS method is valid and effective **during** the CCP.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Understand how deciding CCP status affects the switch between MDS-based and dependency-based aggregation\n\n- **When CCP = true (during the critical period):**  \n  - MDS-based client selection (blue box) is used for classifier collaboration.  \n  - The clients with similar biases are selected dynamically based on current similarity of soft logits.  \n  - Classifier synergy is performed using real-time relevance matching.\n\n- **When CCP = false (outside the critical period):**  \n  - The current similarity distinction degrades → MDS-based selection is no longer effective.  \n  - Instead, historical dependency map \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) (dependency-based) built from past co-learning interactions is used.  \n  - Aggregation uses historical peer matching to maintain personalized classifier synergy efficiently.\n\n- This switch is crucial because continuing MDS beyond CCP causes accuracy degradation and unnecessary computation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of the chain-of-thought:\n\n1. The **red box (CCP?)** indicates the determination of whether the current training round falls within the critical co-learning period.\n2. If CCP = true, meaning it's still early or relevant learning phase, the server performs **client selection by MDS (blue box)** based on similarity of logits.\n3. If CCP = false, the server skips MDS and uses the **historical dependency map \\(\\mathcal{G}\\)** for classifier aggregation.\n4. This adaptive switching prevents accuracy degradation and reduces computational cost.\n5. Thus, the CCP determination governs whether to use **dynamic, similarity-based (MDS) aggregation** or **static, dependency-based aggregation** for classifiers.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe determination of the **critical co-learning period (CCP)** (red box) dictates whether the server applies **MDS-based client selection** (blue box) or switches to a dependency-based aggregation method for classifier synergy. During CCP, MDS is used because classifiers' soft logits similarities clearly indicate relevant client peers, enabling effective dynamic synergy. After CCP, when clients have accumulated sufficient knowledge and the soft logits similarities become ambiguous, MDS becomes ineffective, so the server instead leverages a historical dependency map to perform classifier aggregation. This adaptive switch prevents accuracy degradation and reduces computational complexity in the later training stages."

This feedback loop allows the model to incrementally adjust and improve its pose predictions across multiple rounds, making pose updates dynamic and context-aware.

Part Attention captures high-level part interactions and global context by attending to the features of individual parts, highlighting semantic relationships across the object. Pair Attention complements this by incorporating explicit geometric invariant features—such as distances and orientations between part pairs—ensuring geometric consistency in the assembly. During the update, their attention weights are combined additively to produce a final attention score that guides both semantic and geometric reasoning across parts. This synergistic combination enables the network to effectively capture inter-part geometry, facilitating precise and coherent pose predictions for assembling the object parts."

        "response": "Let's start by understanding what the [mask1] refers to based on the image and context.\n\n### Step 1: Identify What [mask1] Is\nLooking at the figure and the description, the content enclosed within the red box is labeled **Feature Extractor**, which contains two components:\n- **Part Embedder** producing **Part Feature** \\(\\{h_i\\}\\)\n- **Pair Embedder** producing **Pair Feature** \\(\\{z_{ij}\\}\\)\n\nThe Feature Extractor receives the point clouds of each part and outputs node (part) features and edge (pairwise) features.\n\nFrom the text:\n\n> \"In the feature extractor Sec. 3.1, we use PointNet as the backbone network to extract hidden features from each point cloud of each part... The Part Embedder and Pair Embedder, both implemented as 3-layer MLPs..., transform the hidden features into Part Features and Pair Features.\"\n\nTherefore, the [mask1] corresponds to the **Feature Extractor module**, which is a backbone extracting features from point clouds of parts, extracting both part-level and pairwise geometric features.\n\n### Step 2: Understand What Happens When Replacing [mask1] with a Graph Neural Network\nThe question is:  \n**\"What trade-offs emerge when replacing the [mask1] with a graph neural network?\"**\n\nHere the original Feature Extractor extracts local point features with PointNet (or DGCNN), then transforms part features and pair features via MLPs to feed into the Geometric Point Attention Transformer.\n\nReplacing this Feature Extractor would mean to substitute this module with a graph neural network (GNN), presumably one that directly processes parts and their relationships as graph nodes and edges to produce features.\n\n### Step 3: Reasoning About Trade-offs\n\n#### Advantages and Disadvantages of Using a GNN instead of the Original Feature Extractor (PointNet + MLP embedders):\n\n**1. Feature Representation:**\n- The original Feature Extractor relies on PointNet + MLPs to extract per-part features and cross-part pairwise features separately.\n- GNNs can explicitly model interactions between parts via graph edges and perform message passing, potentially encoding relational information more naturally.\n\n**2. Capturing Local Geometry:**\n- PointNet on individual point clouds effectively extracts local geometric features within a part.\n- GNNs operate on part-level nodes and their edges, so they may focus more on inter-part relations rather than intra-part geometry unless enhanced with point-level features.\n\n**3. Computational Complexity and Scalability:**\n- GNNs, depending on number of parts and edges, can be computationally intensive.\n- PointNet + MLPs are relatively straightforward and efficient on individual parts.\n\n**4. Integration of Pose Information:**\n- The paper points out that common architectures, including GNNs, struggle to effectively capture SO(3) rotation and translation features for 6-DoF pose prediction.\n- Their method introduces the geometric point attention module with invariant point attention to address this.\n- Replacing the Feature Extractor with a GNN might not improve—and could even hurt—the ability to capture the complex 6-DoF transformations if the GNN is not explicitly designed for this.\n\n**5. Training and Optimization:**\n- GNNs can suffer from over-smoothing or difficulty in training when many message passing layers are stacked.\n- The baseline methods using GNNs still lag in 6-DoF prediction accuracy (as noted in the \"Related Work\" and experiment sections).\n- The original Feature Extractor setup decouples feature extraction from pose prediction, possibly leading to more stable learning.\n\n**6. Empirical Observations:**\n- Baselines like DGL that utilize GNNs perform well but are outperformed by their approach.\n- Their approach uses PointNet features combined with geometric point attention, leading to improved accuracy.\n\n### Step 4: Summary of Trade-offs\n- **Replacing the Feature Extractor with a GNN may improve relational reasoning across parts** but might degrade the quality of individual part geometric features if not jointly designed.\n- **GNNs alone tend to struggle with directly encoding 6-DoF rotational and translational pose information**, which is critical in shape assembly.\n- **Computational cost might increase** due to message passing over densely connected graphs.\n- **Training stability and performance might be affected**, especially for precise 6-DoF pose regression.\n- **The modular design of separate part and pair embedders combined with geometric point attention appears to better capture local geometry and poses than a vanilla GNN** applied as a feature extractor.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nReplacing the Feature Extractor (the PointNet-based part and pair embedders highlighted as [mask1]) with a graph neural network involves trade-offs between improved relational modeling and potentially degraded local geometric feature extraction. While GNNs can naturally capture inter-part relationships via message passing, they often struggle to effectively represent the intricate 6-DoF rotation and translation information required for precise pose prediction. This can lead to less accurate pose estimations. Additionally, GNNs may increase computational complexity and face challenges such as training instability or over-smoothing with deeper layers. In contrast, the original design employing PointNet to extract high-quality local geometric features, combined with dedicated part and pair embedders and the geometric point attention module, achieves better accuracy in capturing both local part geometry and pose transformations. Hence, replacing the Feature Extractor with a GNN trades off local feature precision and explicit 6-DoF modeling for potentially better cross-part relational reasoning but results in overall lower pose prediction accuracy and higher computational cost."

Static Negative Sampling (SNS)  \n- Uniform SNS: Simple but can cause variability and doesn't consider bias well.  \n- Predefined SNS: Uses real user negative behaviors, but depends on data availability.  \n- Popularity-based SNS: Introduces popularity bias, hence not ideal for diverse users.  \n- Non-sampling SNS: Considers all unobserved items to avoid sampling bias but computationally heavy.\n\n### 2.

This is the core optimization criterion that drives the recommender to learn user preferences in a ranking manner.\n\n2. **Ethical Concerns Arising from Using BPR Loss in Training:**  \n   - **Bias Amplification:**  \n     The BPR loss drives the model to rank observed positive interactions ahead of unobserved or sampled negative interactions. However, if the negative samples contain \"False Negative Samples\" (items that the user may actually like but have not yet interacted with or are misclassified as negative), the training can unfairly penalize those items. This leads to biased learning, reinforcing existing popularity biases or exposure biases in the data. Over time, this can amplify such biases, making recommendations less fair and less diverse.  \n     \n   - **False Negative Problem and Misinterpretations:**  \n     The BPR Loss optimization assumes a clear distinction between positive and negative samples. But as the context explains, implicit feedback datasets often lack explicit negative labels, and randomly or dynamically sampled negatives may include false negatives (items that are relevant or of interest but are treated as negatives). The consequence is that the model might learn misleading preferences, harming the recommendation quality and potentially excluding relevant or niche items.  \n     \n   - **User Preference Misrepresentation:**  \n     Since BPR focuses on pairwise ranking between positives and negatives, any bias or noise in sample selection directly translates into biased gradients. This can cause the model not to accurately reflect true user preferences and limit the diversity or novelty of recommended items, which raises ethical concerns regarding inclusiveness and fairness.  \n     \n   - **Reinforcing Feedback Loops / Echo Chambers:**  \n     Because BPR Loss is optimized over observed interactions and sampled negatives, in systems where popularity bias or filter bubbles exist, it can reinforce these biases by consistently promoting popular or already seen items over new or diverse content. This exacerbates the \"Information Cocoons\" or echo chamber effects, limiting user exposure to diverse viewpoints or products.  \n     \n   - **Privacy and Transparency:**  \n     While not directly addressed by BPR Loss itself, training on implicit interactions combined with pairwise ranking may obscure how user preferences are learned, making it difficult to audit or explain recommendation decisions. This is an ethical concern in terms of user transparency and control.\n\n3. **Summary:**\n\nUsing BPR Loss in recommender system training, while effective for ranking optimization, introduces ethical concerns mainly related to bias amplification, misrepresentation of user preferences due to false negatives, reinforcement of popularity biases and filter bubbles, lack of transparency, and potential unfairness in recommendations. These issues stem from the algorithm treating sampled negatives as truly negative without full certainty, causing unfair penalization and skewed learning behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nEthical concerns arising from using the BPR Loss in the recommender training process include the amplification of biases such as popularity and exposure bias, misrepresentation of user preferences due to false negative samples being treated as negatives, reinforcement of filter bubbles and information cocoons limiting diversity and fairness, and reduced transparency in understanding how recommendations are made. These concerns stem from the loss function's reliance on sampled negative instances which may not truly reflect negative user preferences, potentially leading to unfair or biased outcomes in the recommendation system."

BPR loss provides a principled framework for optimizing the recommender to improve ranking accuracy in implicit feedback settings, addressing data sparsity and enabling efficient and unbiased learning from sampled training signals.**"

These negative samples are more \"confusing,\" pushing the model to better discriminate among closely related labels.\n\n### Step 3: Gather motivation from the text for applying \"Local Hard Negative Sampling\" to each subtask.\n\nKey points from the context:  \n\n- \"Since the positive labels are located within the same sub-space, their hard negative labels are largely overlapped.\"\n- \"Conducting LCL on the corresponding classifiers, their discriminative ability will be enhanced in similar direction and consequently share similar behavior.\"\n- \"These negative labels are challenging because they are different aspects of the same category.

These hard negatives share many characteristics with the positive label, making them the most confusing and thus the most informative negative samples. By training each single-label classification subtask with these local hard negatives, the model improves its discriminative ability specifically in these fine-grained, semantically close label spaces. Moreover, because positive labels along the same hierarchical path share overlapping hard negatives, applying Local Hard Negative Sampling to each subtask drives classifiers to have similar, consistent behavior and enhanced discrimination in related parts of the label hierarchy."

Since the finest-grained labels are hardest to distinguish, starting training from these leaf-level labels and progressively incorporating higher-level coarser labels ensures that the model can better learn fine distinctions before tackling coarser classification. This approach mitigates suppression effects that can occur if training starts from coarser categories and leads to more effective progressive label space division."

Instead of using all negative labels, which may include many easy negatives that are simple to distinguish, the method focuses on \"hard negatives\" – those negative labels that are semantically close to the positive labels.\n\n2. **Definition of hard negatives:**  \n   According to the text, given an input text and one of its positive labels, the closest negative labels are the sibling and descendant labels of the positive label in the label hierarchy. These are defined as the hard negative label set. For example, if \"Football\" is a positive label, then its sibling \"Basketball\" and descendant labels under the same higher category are considered hard negatives.\n\n3. **How does LHN Sampling identify easy negatives?**  \n   Easy negatives are those negative labels outside the sibling and descendant sets. These labels share fewer characteristics with the positive label, making them easier to distinguish from the positive label.\n\n4. **Masking easy negatives:**  \n   The easy negatives (outside the sibling and descendant sets) are masked out during learning, meaning they are excluded from the contrastive learning loss calculation. This is highlighted in the diagram where easy negatives are shown as “masked labels.” This approach prevents the model from wasting effort on distinguishing very easy negatives, focusing training on the more confusable hard negatives.\n\n5. **Resulting effect during label space learning:**  \n   By sampling only the hard negatives from sibling and descendant labels, the model is encouraged to learn to distinguish between closely related categories. This enhances the consistency of contrastive learning and improves the discriminative ability of the classifiers in a hierarchical way.\n\n**Summary Answer:**  \nLocal Hard Negative Sampling identifies easy negatives as those labels that are outside the sibling and descendant label sets of the positive label in the hierarchy. These easy negatives share fewer characteristics with the positive label and are therefore easier to distinguish. During label space learning, LHN Sampling masks out these easy negative labels—excluding them from the contrastive learning process—so that the model focuses on distinguishing the more challenging hard negatives (sibling and descendant negative labels), thereby improving learning efficiency and classifier behavior consistency."

Using the sign of the gradient multiplied by step size α (αsgn(∇L(F*,F))) to calculate the perturbation update.\n\nThis is exactly the gradient step used to generate adversarial perturbations, which are backpropagated through the feature extractor to modify the input image slightly such that the extracted features move closer to a target feature set.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Align This Understanding with the Context\n\nFrom the context, especially the **Method: \"Solving perturbations\"** and **Attack formulation:**\n\n- BankTweak is a white-box attack on multi-object tracking systems, focusing on the association phase by manipulating the features extracted for detected objects.\n\n- The method uses **iterative perturbation generation** via PGD (Projected Gradient Descent), with gradient updates computed through backpropagation from the feature extractor.\n\n- Equation (2) in the text formalizes the perturbation update as:\n\n  \\[\n  \\delta^{r+1} = \\text{Clip}_\\epsilon\\left( \\delta^r - \\alpha \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\nabla_\\delta \\mathcal{L}(F^*, F)) \\right)\n  \\]\n\n  This aligns with the figure's backpropagation step.\n\n- The perturbations are projected back to the input image according to each detected object's position.\n\n- This process is repeated R times, iteratively refining the perturbations.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Comparison to Typical Gradient-Based Adversarial Methods\n\n- **Typical gradient-based adversarial attacks** (like FGSM, PGD) also use a similar gradient calculation through a loss function, based on the final outputs (e.g., classification logits), backpropagated to the input image.\n\n- In standard classification adversarial attacks:\n\n  - Loss compares predicted class scores to the true or target label.\n\n  - Gradients are computed with respect to input pixels.\n\n- In BankTweak:\n\n  - Instead of classification logits, the feature extractor outputs a **feature vector** per detected object.\n\n  - The loss compares the extracted features **F*** to target features **F** (e.g., cosine distance-based losses aiming to push features closer or farther apart to manipulate matching).\n\n  - The backpropagation gradient is computed through the feature extractor network (OSNet in experiments), back to the input image patch corresponding to each detected object.\n\n- Thus, BankTweak uniquely:\n\n  - Focuses on **feature space perturbations** rather than classification output perturbations.\n\n  - Perturbs only patches corresponding to detected objects extracted by the detector.\n\n  - Uses a **feature similarity/distance loss**, unlike usual classification loss-based attacks.\n\n- Therefore, while the step using αsgn(∇L(F*,F)) is conceptually similar to PGD/FGSM gradient updates, the **loss function and target output differ**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Summary Answer\n\n**BankTweak’s use of backpropagation αsgn(∇L(F*,F)) integrates with the feature extractor (labeled as [mask1]) to iteratively generate perturbations that specifically manipulate the extracted object features to induce ID switches in multi-object tracking.**\n\nUnlike standard gradient-based adversarial methods that manipulate classification outputs via losses on predicted labels, BankTweak backpropagates gradients from a custom loss defined on the similarity/dissimilarity between adversarial target features and extracted features. This nuance allows it to focus on the feature space used for object association rather than detection or classification, enabling efficient, targeted perturbations that disrupt feature matching in tracking without causing detection failures or false positives.\n\n---\n\n# **Final Answer:**\n\nThe backpropagation step αsgn(∇L(F*,F)) in [mask1] corresponds to computing the gradient of a loss function based on the similarity between the extracted features (**F* **) from the feature extractor and the desired target features (**F**). This gradient is backpropagated through the feature extractor network to generate perturbations on the input image patches of detected objects. Compared to conventional gradient-based adversarial methods (like FGSM or PGD), which calculate gradients based on classification losses for entire images, BankTweak focuses specifically on the feature extractor output used in multi-object tracking for association. By defining a feature similarity/distance loss and applying backpropagation through the feature extractor on detected object regions, BankTweak generates targeted perturbations that manipulate object features to cause persistent ID switches without affecting detection accuracy or generating false positives. This specialized use of backpropagation makes BankTweak more effective and robust in the multi-object tracking context than typical classification-based adversarial attacks."

This corresponds to the object detection phase in the BankTweak framework. Detection refers to identifying objects and producing bounding boxes on the input image, which later serve as regions of interest for feature extraction.\n\n- **[mask2] (blue box):** The blue box highlights the combined process of \"Adding perturbation\" back into the input image before detection. This represents the phase where the generated adversarial perturbations are applied to the input image, modifying it iteratively to fool the detection and/or feature extraction stages.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Understanding detection-driven adversarial attack strategies**\n\nFrom the context:\n\n- **Detection-driven attacks** typically target the detector \\( D(\\cdot) \\) by adding perturbations to the input image so as to fool the detector into misdetecting or missing objects.\n\n- This involves perturbations applied directly to the input image, which cause changes in detection results.\n\n- However, BankTweak explicitly focuses on the **association phase**, i.e., the feature extractor \\( E(\\cdot) \\), not just detector \\( D(\\cdot) \\).\n\n- The red box corresponds exactly to the detector alone, performing object detection.\n\n- The blue box encompasses the stage of adding perturbations to the input image before detection, which would influence the detector's outputs.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Role and influence of the detector (red box) relative to the adding perturbation stage (blue box)**\n\n- The detector is the model that finds objects in the image \\( I_t \\) or \\( \\tilde{I_t} \\).\n\n- Detection-driven attack strategies would mostly involve applying perturbations so that this detector fails or produces incorrect outputs (missed detections or false positives).\n\n- However, per the context, BankTweak targets not only detection but mainly association by generating perturbations that influence feature extraction and identity assignment.\n\n- Perturbations added at the \"Adding perturbation\" stage (blue box) affect the input to the detector (red box).\n\n- The detector's outputs are sensitive to the perturbations because those perturbations can alter bounding boxes and object proposals.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: How does Detector \\(D(\\cdot)\\) influence Adding perturbation stage relative to detection-driven attack?**\n\n- Actually, the influence is the other way around: Adding perturbation (blue box) influences the detector \\( D(\\cdot) \\) (red box).\n\n- But the question asks: How does [mask1] (Detector \\( D(\\cdot) \\)) influence [mask2] (Adding perturbation) **relative to detection-driven adversarial attack strategies**?\n\n- In other words, compared to detection-driven methods which rely mainly on perturbations affecting detection, BankTweak uses the detector's output to guide **where** and **how** perturbations are applied, specifically targeting feature extractor behaviors.\n\n- The detection, i.e., detected object bounding boxes, **informs the projection and calculation of perturbations** (Step 5 in the figure).\n\n- The detector's output is critical to identify object locations to which perturbations (mask2) are projected and applied.\n\n- Thus, the detector \\( D(\\cdot) \\) influences how the perturbations are spatially added to the image.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Summarize the answer**\n\n- The Detector \\( D(\\cdot) \\) provides detection results (object bounding boxes and positions) that are essential for localizing and projecting the perturbations onto specific object regions in the input image (the Adding perturbation stage).\n\n- Relative to detection-driven adversarial attacks that focus on causing misdetections by perturbing the whole image or detector inputs, BankTweak exploits the detector's outputs to apply perturbations directly and meticulously onto object regions based on their positions.\n\n- This targeted perturbation approach allows BankTweak to manipulate later feature extraction and association phases more precisely, rather than bluntly attacking detection alone.\n\n---\n\n### **Final concise answer:**\n\nThe Detector \\( D(\\cdot) \\) ([mask1]) influences the Adding perturbation stage ([mask2]) by providing precise object location information through detection outputs. This enables BankTweak to project and apply perturbations specifically onto detected object regions, allowing targeted manipulation of object features. Unlike conventional detection-driven attacks that broadly perturb inputs to fool detection, BankTweak leverages detection results to carefully localize perturbations, thereby exerting control over the feature extraction and association phase for inducing consistent ID switches."

This enables fine-grained, token-level interactions where video features can selectively attend to corresponding sketch features, thereby injecting detailed sketch semantics into the latent space. The predefined binary matrix \\( \\mathcal{A} \\) constrains these attention interactions to relevant pairs, ensuring structured semantic alignment. The sketch attention output is then combined additively with the original spatial self-attention output and modulated by a learnable scaling parameter, allowing adaptive weighting of the injected sketch information during denoising."

FiLM applies modulation by affine transform parameters from external inputs; it does not self-standardize the features it modulates.\n\nStep 3: How does standardized self-scaling improve upon FiLM?  \n- Standardized self-scaling \"standardizes the sketch features (i.e., adjust via mean and std) before scaling,\" capturing the high-contrast transitions between sketch lines and white backgrounds more adaptively.  \n- This self-scaling method highlights the contrast within the same feature map (self-modulation) rather than applying an external learned affine transform as FiLM does.  \n- This enables better distinction and adaptive emphasis on sketch details that are crucial for the video repainting task, especially since the sketch has strong structural contrast.  \n- Additionally, the technique reduces computational cost by being applied once to the first transformer block.\n\nStep 4: Summarize the refinement over FiLM:  \n- Unlike FiLM, which applies a fixed affine modulation from learned parameters, standardized self-scaling performs an adaptive normalization and scaling using the feature statistics themselves.  \n- This leads to a more precise capturing of the high-contrast sketch details, which is important for accurately injecting structural information for video instance repainting.\n\nFinal Answer:  \nThe standardized self-scaling after Sequential ControlNet refines sketch feature modulation by adaptively capturing high-contrast structure details through self-normalization and scaling of the sketch features, rather than using fixed learned affine parameters as FiLM does. This approach highlights structural transitions in the sketch more effectively, enabling better feature modulation tailored to the sketch’s contrast characteristics, resulting in improved injection of structural information into the denoising network for video repainting."

This can lead to incomplete, biased, or unrepresentative drafts since crucial evidence might be missing from the subset, thereby affecting the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the drafted answer.\n\n---\n\n# **Answer:**\n\nThe Specialist RAG Drafter faces risks related to **limited representativeness** because it generates each draft from a subset of documents sampled from topic clusters. As a result, each draft may lack some important information present in other document clusters, leading to drafts that are **not fully representative of the entire set of retrieved documents**.

Three of these RFs are allocated for accumulating input activations from three separate positions of the sliding convolution kernel ...

Generative models, such as GANs and Autoencoders, play an important role here by leveraging unlabeled emotion signals.\n\n2. **How does semi-supervised learning work in this context?**  \n   The context explains that generative models generate synthetic samples to augment the training data, and discriminators or classifiers predict pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples. This process allows the encoder or feature extractor to learn from both labeled and unlabeled data, improving the generalization of emotion recognition models.\n\n3. **Role of [mask2] (Classifying with discrete and dimensional emotion models)**  \n   The blue box represents the classification step in emotion recognition, where the extracted and refined features are fed into discrete emotion models (emotion categories like happy, sad, angry) or dimensional emotion models (valence-arousal dimensions) to identify emotional states.\n\n4. **How [mask1] leverages [mask2] feedback to refine encoder representations**  \n   The semi-supervised learning process uses the classification results (feedback from the classifying module) to guide the training of the encoder. For example, the discriminator/classifier in GAN-based semi-supervised learning not only distinguishes real vs. synthetic data but also assigns emotion labels to the real samples and pseudo-labels to unlabeled samples. This feedback enables the encoder to improve its feature extraction by learning representations that better discriminate emotional classes, even for unlabeled data.\n\n5. **Summary from the context and figure**  \n   Semi-supervised generative models generate synthetic emotional data or latent representations, which are then classified to provide pseudo-labels or supervised signals. The classification feedback is incorporated into the training loss and used to update the encoder network, making the latent representations more discriminative and aligned with emotion categories. This joint optimization improves emotion recognition performance using both labeled and unlabeled emotional signals.\n\n**Final answer:**  \nSemi-supervised learning ([mask1]) leverages the classification feedback ([mask2]) by using the discriminator or classifier’s predictions on both labeled and unlabeled emotion signals to provide pseudo-labels and supervised signals. This feedback is used to update and refine the encoder representations, enabling the model to learn more discriminative and generalized features for emotion recognition from unlabeled data. The encoder thus benefits from classification guidance to better capture emotional characteristics, enhancing overall performance in recognizing emotions."

This synergy allows the model to explore and represent a larger, more nuanced emotional space due to enhanced data variety and improved learning from multiple data sources, ultimately leading to more robust and generalizable SER performance.\n\nIn summary, GAN-based data augmentation ([mask1]) produces realistic and diverse synthetic emotional speech samples that augment limited datasets, while semi-supervised learning ([mask2]) leverages this augmented data alongside unlabeled real data to learn richer, more comprehensive emotional representations. Together, they expand the emotion representation space effectively for improved speech emotion recognition."

Based on the diagram and the extensive context provided, here is how Diffusion Model (DM) features integrate with cross-domain adaptation to mitigate distribution shifts:\n\n1. **Understanding Diffusion Model Features:**\n   - Diffusion Models learn data distributions by a forward process that gradually adds noise to the data and a reverse denoising process to generate clean samples.\n   - They are capable of generating high-quality, diverse emotional samples by iteratively refining noisy data into realistic emotional features.\n   - The training optimizes a noise prediction function to progressively reconstruct data distributions similar to the true emotional data.\n\n2. **Cross-Domain Adaptation Challenges:**\n   - Emotion recognition models often suffer from degraded performance when applied to different domains due to variations in language, culture, recording conditions, and speaker characteristics.\n   - These differences cause distribution shifts between source and target domains making models trained on one domain less effective when directly applied to another.\n\n3. **Integration of Diffusion Model Features with Cross-Domain Adaptation:**\n   - Diffusion Models can be used to generate domain-invariant and generalized features by learning smooth latent distributions that capture the intrinsic data manifold of emotional signals.\n   - By generating or reconstructing emotional data that is representative of multiple domains, diffusion model-based feature extraction helps bridge the gap between source and target domains.\n   - These domain-invariant representations reduce the distribution discrepancies and allow emotion recognition models to better generalize in cross-domain scenarios.\n   - When combined with domain adaptation techniques (such as domain-invariant feature learning or adversarial training), diffusion model features can enhance the alignment of feature distributions across domains.\n\n4. **Supporting Evidence from Context:**\n   - The context mentions that generative models, including Diffusion Models, are employed to extract generalized and domain-invariant representations, mitigating performance degradation caused by distribution inconsistencies between domains.\n   - Methods such as using separate encoders and adding domain adaptation losses help map different domain samples into a shared feature space, which diffusion models support via their robust generative and denoising capabilities.\n\n**Summary Answer:**\n\nDiffusion Model features integrate with cross-domain adaptation by learning smooth, domain-invariant latent representations through iterative denoising processes. This enables the extraction and generation of generalized emotional features that reduce distribution shifts between source and target domains, thereby improving the adaptability and robustness of emotion recognition models across different domains. This integration helps achieve better alignment of cross-domain feature distributions and enhances model generalization in scenarios where data distributions vary significantly."

This stage is labeled \"Global BA,\" which stands for Global Bundle Adjustment.\n\n2. **Role of Global Bundle Adjustment in SfM:**  \n   In Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines, Global Bundle Adjustment is the nonlinear optimization step that refines camera poses and 3D point locations simultaneously to minimize the reprojection error across the entire dataset. It uses an initial estimate of camera poses and 3D structure to recover a globally consistent reconstruction.\n\n3. **Preceding Steps Providing Initialization:**  \n   According to the context, the pipeline first extracts trajectories marked as visible and static (non-dynamic) from the DATAP point tracking. Then, initial camera pose estimates are obtained through two geometric averaging steps:  \n   - **Translation Averaging** (cited from Ozyesil & Singer, 2015)  \n   - **Rotation Averaging** (cited from Chatterjee & Govindu, 2013)  \n   \n   These averaging methods combine pairwise relative pose information over the entire sequence to produce a robust initial guess of the global camera poses.\n\n4. **How Translation and Rotation Averaging Work in This Pipeline:**  \n   These averaging steps resemble those common in global SfM techniques, where pairwise relative rotations and translations are globally combined to produce camera orientations and positions in a consistent coordinate frame. This establishes a baseline for the 3D reconstruction.\n\n5. **Proceeding to Global Bundle Adjustment:**  \n   With these initial poses, Global Bundle Adjustment (the [mask1] stage) optimizes camera poses and 3D point positions over all frames and features jointly, improving accuracy and consistency in camera trajectory and scene geometry. The final output consists of refined camera poses and the mapping (point cloud).\n\n6. **Depth Alignment and Fusion:**  \n   Additionally, the system aligns SfM results with monocular depth estimates by scaling and integrating dynamic point clouds to obtain a complete and consistent 3D scene representation.\n\n**Summary Answer:**  \nThe [mask1] \"Global BA\" stage implements translation and rotation averaging akin to global SfM pipelines by first extracting static and visible point trajectories from DATAP, then applying translation averaging to estimate initial camera positions and rotation averaging to estimate initial camera orientations globally. These provide initial pose estimates that are refined jointly through global bundle adjustment to produce accurate and smooth camera trajectories and consistent 3D point mapping. This process consolidates information across all views to achieve global consistency typical of global SfM methods."

The depth information enables back-projection of points into 3D camera coordinates, allowing estimation of scene flow and richer trajectory features that disambiguate moving points from static ones. This depth-aware trajectory encoding, combined with a transformer encoder and OANet decoder, enhances the discriminative power for motion segmentation. Consequently, fusing this depth-informed dynamic prediction with DATAP’s initial predictions resolves ambiguities inherent in solely 2D tracking, leading to more accurate, stable, and reliable dynamic mask predictions."

Identify [mask1]: The red box in the detailed DATAP Framework diagram highlights the component called \"Iterative transformer updates,\" which contains multiple transformer update iterations (transformer updates x K). According to the context, these updates progressively refine the estimates of track positions and features, but do not update visibility and dynamic masks until the last iteration.\n\n2. Understand the role of correlation features:\n- Correlation features (\\( f_c \\)) are computed by dot-product correlations between track features (\\( f_t \\)) and image features (\\( f_i \\)) surrounding the current estimate of the track position.\n- These correlation features capture local similarity and matching evidence between the tracked points and image features at current positions.\n- The correlation features are part of the input tokens to the transformer along with position, visibility, dynamics, and appearance features.\n- Therefore, correlation features provide the transformer with important information about where points currently appear in each frame relative to their expected track positions.\n\n3. How do the iterative transformer updates and correlation features work together for static point selection before global BA?\n- The iterative transformer updates use the input tokens (including correlation features) to progressively update the predicted point positions (\\( p_j^k \\)) and features (\\( f_j^k \\)).\n- Through this iterative refinement, the model can better localize points over time and also refine visibility and dynamics predictions (visibility updated by MLP+sigmoid; dynamics further refined by depth-aware segmentation).\n- Specifically, the refined point locations and visibility help to reject points that are occluded or track poorly.\n- Depth-aware trajectory motion segmentation further refines dynamic/static classification by using the enhanced tracking features.\n- Once point trajectories are labeled as visible and static, they are selected for the global bundle adjustment (BA) stage.\n\n4. Impact on static point selection before global BA:\n- The combination of correlation features and iterative transformer updates ensures that point trajectories are accurately tracked and refined in terms of their spatial location and appearance similarity.\n- This accuracy and confidence in track quality enable the identification of points that remain static (not moving relative to the camera) and visible throughout frames.\n- These static and visible points are then extracted as reliable correspondences for global BA, improving camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction consistency.\n\nFinal answer:\n\nThe \"Iterative transformer updates\" ([mask1]) progressively refine the position and feature estimates of tracked points by repeatedly processing input tokens that include correlation features, which represent local similarity between track and image features. These correlation features provide critical matching evidence that helps the transformer localize and update point trajectories accurately. Together, they improve the quality and reliability of the point tracks by refining their visibility and dynamic states. As a result, points that are consistently visible and classified as static through this process are selected as input for the global bundle adjustment, ensuring robust and accurate camera pose estimation and mapping.

It captures fine-grained dynamics of the market by modeling each trading order with its preceding context such as Limit Order Book (LOB). This handles order-level market dynamics sequentially.\n\n- **Order-Batch Model**: This model is not boxed separately but referred to in the text as modeling sequences of aggregated order batches (groups of orders aggregated at a specific time interval). It captures broader time-scale market dynamics and patterns via an auto-regressive transformer.\n\n- **Ensemble Model ([mask1])**: This model combines the order sequence modeling (order model) and the order-batch modeling into a unified framework.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Extract relevant information from the context about how the **Ensemble Model** integrates and guides order generation.\n\nFrom Section **2.2.1 Framework Design of Large Market Model**:  \n- The **Ensemble Model** integrates the two complementary approaches of order sequence modeling (Order Model) and order-batch sequence modeling (Order-Batch Model).\n- It balances the fine-grained control of individual orders from the **Order Model** with the broader market dynamics from the **Order-Batch Model**.\n- This integration enables improved market modeling and generation, ensuring the simulations are both detailed and contextually accurate.\n- The ensemble model directs order generation in a way that reflects realistic market conditions by balancing micro (order-level) and macro (order-batch-level) signals.\n\nFrom **MarS — Order Generation Combined with Simulated Clearing House**:  \n- The ensemble model influences order generation, aligning order-level generation with the selected \"best match\" next order-batch that softly controls the direction of generation.\n- The trade-off between market impact (fine-grained changes learned from orders) and control signal (broader contextual guidance from order-batches) is managed through the ensemble model.\n- At each time step, multiple candidate order-batches are generated and one is selected that best fits the control signals (e.g., from user, scenario). The ensemble model then guides the order-level generation based on this choice.\n- The integration allows the model to \"shape the future based on realized realities\" while \"electing the best from every possible future\" to maintain realistic simulation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Summarize the answer concisely\n\nThe **Ensemble Model ([mask1])** integrates the fine-grained, sequential order signals from the **Order Model ([mask2])** and the broader, time-aggregated order-batch outputs from the Order-Batch Model by balancing their strengths: it uses the detailed order-level context from the order model and the macro-level patterns/control from the order-batch model to guide and constrain order generation. This joint approach ensures that generated orders reflect both realistic immediate market impacts and align with higher-level market dynamics and control signals. The ensemble model works by selecting order-batches that best match control conditions and then influencing the order-level generation to be coherent with this selection, thus guiding realistic and controllable order generation.\n\n---\n\n# **Final Answer:**\n\nThe **Ensemble Model** integrates the **Order Model** and order-batch model outputs by combining the fine-grained, sequential order-level information from the Order Model with the broader, aggregated time-scale patterns from the order-batch model. It balances detailed order dynamics with overall market batch patterns to guide the generation of orders. Specifically, it uses the order-batch model to propose multiple candidate next order batches and selects the best match to the control signals (such as user input or scenario prompts). The ensemble model then influences the order-level generation from the Order Model to align with this selected batch, achieving a realistic trade-off between market impact and control, thereby guiding conditional and interactive order generation in a coherent and controllable manner."

This data captures detailed, fine-grained information about individual trading orders, their sequences, batches, and the resulting Limit Order Book dynamics.\n   - The richness and granularity of this data enable MarS to simulate realistic market trajectories, market impacts, and complex interactions between trading participants.\n\n2. **Privacy Risks for Market Participants:**\n   - Because order-level data contains detailed transactional information—such as the timing, size, price, and sequence of individual orders—it inherently carries sensitive information about market participants’ strategies and behaviors.\n   - Relying heavily on order-level historical data raises privacy concerns, as the detailed data might reveal proprietary trading intentions or identities (even if anonymized, advanced inference techniques could potentially re-identify participants or their strategies).\n   - The dataset could also contain data about rare or extreme trading actions that are unique or traceable to specific entities, further exacerbating privacy risks.\n\n3. **Risks of Data Bias:**\n   - Order-level historical market data reflects actual historical market conditions, which include biases such as the dominance of certain market participants, specific market regimes, or unusual market events (e.g., manipulation periods, flash crashes).\n   - Since these 'anomalies' or biases exist in minority portions of historical data, the model might underperform in these areas or learn representations skewed toward more common market behaviors.\n   - Over-representation of particular trading styles or asset classes could lead the model to simulate unrealistic or biased scenarios in other contexts.\n   - The paper itself mentions that performance drops during market manipulation periods because these scenarios are underrepresented—indicating possible bias or lack of model robustness for rare events.\n\n4. **Summary:**\n   - Relying on order-level historical market data poses **privacy risks** because of the sensitive and fine-grained nature of transactional data, potentially exposing proprietary strategies or participant identities.\n   - It also poses **data bias risks** due to imbalances and anomalies present in historical data, causing the model to underrepresent or misrepresent rare but important market phenomena.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nRelying on order-level historical market data poses risks to market participant privacy because the highly detailed and fine-grained nature of this data may reveal sensitive trading behaviors or strategies, potentially enabling re-identification of participants or exposure of proprietary information. Additionally, it poses risks of data bias as historical market data may be skewed toward prevalent market conditions, dominant trading behaviors, or rare anomalous events (such as market manipulation) that are underrepresented in the training set. This can lead to a model that underperforms or behaves inconsistently in less common but critical scenarios, limiting the realism and fairness of simulations based on such data."

This state serves as an input condition for LMM’s next order generation.\n\n2. **Real-time Interaction Dependency**:  \n   The generation of each new order \\(y_{i+1}\\) depends on order \\(y_i\\) and the immediate matching results including user interactive orders \\(o_i\\). If this feedback is delayed, LMM cannot condition its generation on accurate and up-to-date market states.\n\n3. **Latency Impact**:  \n   - **Increased Latency → stale matching info**: The simulation model receives outdated or delayed matching results.  \n   - **Outdated state leads to order mismatch**: Generated orders will no longer reflect the true interactive orders or market state, reducing realism and accuracy.  \n   - **Reduced Fidelity**: The generated sequences will deviate from credible market dynamics, losing the fine-grained realism that MarS aims for.\n\n4. **Fidelity of Generated Order Sequences**:  \n   Fidelity means how realistic and accurate the generated sequences are relative to expected market conditions. This depends heavily on up-to-date and accurate market states generated by the clearing house.\n\n5. **Summary**:  \n   Therefore, the latency (delay/time lag) in the Simulated Clearing House’s matching process and feedback loop directly degrades the timeliness and accuracy of state information used by LMM. This degradation lowers the **fidelity** of generated order sequences during real-time interaction, because the generation model cannot react instantaneously and accurately to user submissions or market developments.\n\n---\n\n### **Answer**:\n\nLatency in the Simulated Clearing House delays the processing and matching of generated and user-submitted orders, causing the Large Market Model to receive outdated market state information for guiding subsequent order generation. This delay reduces the fidelity of the generated order sequences during real-time interaction because the model can no longer accurately reflect the immediate market impact of user interactions, leading to less realistic and less responsive simulated market dynamics."

Potential adaptations could include:\n\n1. **Bias detection and filtering at the semantic input stage**:  \n   - The text encoder (which feeds into SVS) could incorporate a bias detection or content moderation module that flags or filters biased/harmful prompts before semantic alignment.  \n   - Preprocessing text with fairness-aware NLP tools before entering SVS.\n\n2. **Incorporate ethical constraints within Cross-Attention or Latent Transformation**:  \n   - Modify the cross-attention mechanism to weigh semantic tokens differently based on detected bias or ethical flags, potentially suppressing harmful or stereotypical semantic features.  \n   - Introduce an ethical alignment loss function during training that penalizes generation of biased or harmful content.\n\n3. **Use training data that is curated to minimize bias**:  \n   - SVS relies on learned semantic-visual alignment; ensuring training data is balanced and free from biased associations can help the model learn to avoid amplifying stereotypes.  \n   - This is indirectly referenced in the training on Objaverse dataset and curated text-object pairs.\n\n4. **Integration of external ethical/AI alignment models**:  \n   - Optionally incorporate an external ethical judgment module that evaluates latent features in SVS or final rendered views for fairness or bias and guides corrective feedback for inference.\n\n5. **User feedback loop**:  \n   - While not directly mentioned, integrating user feedback to flag and correct biased outputs could be included in SVS adaptation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Summarize the reasoning into a coherent answer\n\nThe Semantic-aligned View Synthesizer (SVS) adapts the alignment between textual semantics and 3D visuals through cross-attention and orthogonal attention. To handle user bias ethically, it can be adapted by integrating bias detection and filtering at the text input stage; modifying the cross-attention layers to suppress biased semantic features; incorporating ethical constraints or bias-mitigating loss functions during training; using carefully curated, balanced training data; and potentially integrating external modules that monitor and correct biased content during generation. These adaptations ensure the semantic alignment within SVS promotes fair, unbiased, and ethical 3D content generation in response to user text prompts.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe **Semantic-aligned View Synthesizer (SVS)** could be adapted to handle user bias in text prompts ethically by integrating bias detection and filtering mechanisms in the textual input processing, modifying its cross-attention module to suppress or reweight biased or harmful semantic features, incorporating ethical alignment constraints in its training objective, leveraging carefully curated, balanced datasets to reduce learned biases, and potentially employing external ethical evaluation modules to monitor and correct the semantic-to-3D alignments. These adaptations help ensure that the semantic alignment process within SVS generates 3D content that is consistent with user prompts while respecting ethical guidelines and avoiding the amplification of harmful biases."

This step is important because the pretrained T2I models have diverse generation capability that includes extraneous details irrelevant to the triplane prior. If these irrelevant features are learned, the spatial correspondence would be noisy and poor.\n\n- The second step (Triplane Orthogonalization) comes **after** Object Retention because once the model can reliably generate clear, focused images of the object, it can then **learn the spatial and geometric consistency across the three orthogonal views (front, top, side)** that constitute the triplane prior. Learning these spatial correspondences is critical to ensure multi-view consistency and proper 3D representation.\n\n- Attempting Triplane Orthogonalization *without* first retaining the main object leads to difficulties because attention mechanisms and regressed triplane features get confused or overwhelmed by irrelevant background or noisy features.\n\n- The introduction of Orthogonal Attention in the TO step addresses inadequacies of previous temporal attention to handle the sparse and shifted pixels of triplanes with large deviations between views.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Summarize the motivation for the sequential approach\n\n- **First retain the core object to remove noise and irrelevant content ([mask1])**  \n- **Then learn multi-view spatial orthogonal relations accurately to obtain consistent triplane representation ([mask2])**\n\nThis order stabilizes training and enhances representation quality.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nThe sequential application of [mask1] Object Retention followed by [mask2] Triplane Orthogonalization in the prior learner is motivated by the need to first isolate and preserve the primary object of interest, removing irrelevant background and distracting elements that pretrained text-to-image models often generate. This object-focused representation enables a cleaner, more stable foundation on which to subsequently learn the precise spatial orthogonal correspondences and multi-view consistency across the triplane prior. Without first retaining the main object, learning spatial relationships in the triplane would be compromised by noise and irrelevant features. Thus, Object Retention ensures the model focuses on the main object, enabling Triplane Orthogonalization to effectively enforce accurate 3D spatial consistency and correspondence within the triplane prior."

Cross Attention integrates semantic information from the text prompt with visual features in the triplane latent space, aligning textual descriptions with corresponding 3D structures. Orthogonal Attention, on the other hand, enforces the orthogonal spatial relationships between different triplane views to maintain multi-view consistency. Together, they ensure that the transformed triplane latents are both semantically meaningful and spatially consistent, leading to accurate and coherent 3D representation that aligns well with the semantic prompt.\n\n---\n\nHence, Cross Attention is coupled with Orthogonal Attention because it **facilitates semantic-visual alignment which, combined with spatial consistency constraints from Orthogonal Attention, leads to improved semantic alignment and multi-view consistency in triplane latent space**."

This ensures that depth maps generated afterward are already aligned in space, enabling direct comparison and fusion of the multimodal depth data.

Reconstruction (from raw and RGB data, segmentation, depth estimation)\n  2. [mask1] Joint Alignment — aligning sensor reconstructions spatially\n  3. [mask2] Depth Deviation Measurement — measuring deviations between sensors and ground truth\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Why is Joint Alignment necessary before Depth Deviation measurement?\n\nFrom the textual context, particularly Section 5.2 (Data Acquisition Pipeline) and Section 6 (Evaluation), the following key points elaborate on this:\n\n1. **Spatial Calibration and Alignment**:\n   - Sensors have different coordinate systems.\n   - The MAROON dataset uses a spatial calibration method (Wirth et al., 2024) using spherical markers to spatially align and register reconstructions from all sensors into a common metric coordinate space.\n   - This step is essential because **comparison of depth values or point clouds across sensors only makes sense if they are referenced to the same coordinate system.**\n\n2. **Reconstruction produces depth maps or point clouds in sensor-specific coordinate frames**:\n   - Each sensor reconstructs objects from its own viewpoint using its own intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.\n   - These reconstructions can vary spatially (translation, rotation), scale, or orientation.\n\n3. **Joint Alignment (Step in [mask1])**:\n   - Applies a rigid transformation `[R | t]` (rotation and translation) to bring sensor reconstructions into alignment with the ground truth or between sensors.\n   - Ensures that corresponding points on the object surfaces overlap as closely as possible, enabling a meaningful point-wise comparison.\n\n4. **Depth Deviation Measurement (Step in [mask2])**:\n   - Quantifies reconstruction inaccuracies by calculating distance metrics (Chamfer distance, projective error) between aligned point clouds or depth maps.\n   - These metrics require the data to be aligned; otherwise, deviations could reflect coordinate misalignment, not sensor errors.\n\n5. **Chain of necessity**:\n   - Reconstruction → Produce raw depth/point data (sensor-dependent coordinates)\n   - Joint Alignment → Transform data into common coordinate reference frame\n   - Depth Deviation Measurement → Compare aligned data to measure sensor accuracy and deviations\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\n**Inserting the Joint Alignment step between Reconstruction and Depth Deviation Measurement is motivated by the necessity to spatially register all sensor outputs into a unified coordinate system. Without this spatial alignment, deviation calculations would be invalid or misleading because the sensor data would be misaligned spatially. Thus, Joint Alignment enables a precise, point-wise comparison of depth data among different sensors and with ground truth.**\n\n---\n\n# Final answer:\n\n**The insertion of [mask1] Joint Alignment between Reconstruction and [mask2] Depth Deviation Measurement is motivated by the need to spatially register and align all sensor reconstructions into a common coordinate system. This step ensures that the reconstructed depth data from different sensors (and the ground truth) are properly aligned in space, allowing subsequent deviation measurements to accurately reflect differences in sensor depth estimation rather than coordinate system misalignment. Without this alignment, comparing and quantifying deviations between different sensor outputs would be invalid and misleading.**"

(2024)  \n  - Four spherical objects optimized for visibility in optical and RF domains are captured by all sensors.  \n  - In each sensor’s 3D reconstruction, these spheres are automatically located.  \n  - They are jointly aligned using spatial registration, resulting in a transformation between individual sensor coordinate systems.  \n  - This yields a common coordinate system and spatial calibration parameters denoted [R|t].  \n  - The expected error of this calibration is on the order of 1–2 mm Chamfer distance.  \n- [R|t] commonly denotes a rigid body transformation composed of rotation matrix R and translation vector t.\n- The spatial calibration aligns disparate sensor coordinate systems into a unified metric reference frame so that data from different sensors can be directly compared.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **What is [mask1]?**  \n   The content boxed in red is \"Spatial Calibration,\" showing vectors labeled [R|t], indicating the estimation of rotation and translation aligning sensor coordinate systems.\n\n2. **What is the goal of spatial calibration in this context?**  \n   To find the optimal rotation (R) and translation (t) that transform the coordinate system of each sensor, e.g., optical, NIR ToF, RF ToF, into one common global coordinate system.\n\n3. **How is this optimization done?**  \n   Based on the text:  \n   - Four spherical objects visible to all sensors are identified and reconstructed independently by each sensor.  \n   - Their positions in each sensor's data are known.  \n   - Using spatial registration techniques, correspondences between the spheres’ centers seen by different sensors are found.  \n   - An optimization is performed to find the rigid transformation ([R|t]) that best aligns these known points across different sensors in a least-squares or similar error-minimizing manner.  \n   - This is a standard multi-view registration calibration problem.\n\n4. **Why is this important?**  \n   Because sensors vary in modality, geometry, position, and coordinate systems, their 3D data are initially misaligned. The estimated transformation [R|t] maps each sensor’s reconstruction into a unified metric space, enabling joint evaluation and comparison.\n\n5. **What information from the diagram supports this?**  \n   - The red-boxed circle shows arrows converging between colored coordinate systems, which visualize spatial alignment.  \n   - The dashed arrow going back to \"Object Preparation\" indicates that this calibration step is optional or iterative for improving texture application or other processing.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\n**The Spatial Calibration step (highlighted by [mask1]) optimizes the rigid transformation parameters, consisting of a rotation matrix (R) and translation vector (t), by using spatial registration of known reference objects (four spherical targets) visible to all sensors. By detecting these spheres in each sensor’s 3D reconstruction, the method estimates [R|t] that best aligns each sensor's coordinate system into a common metric frame, enabling direct comparison of multimodal depth data. This alignment is typically solved by minimizing spatial discrepancies (e.g., Chamfer distance) between corresponding points, thus jointly calibrating all sensors into a unified coordinate system.**"

Manual correction is performed to ensure accuracy. The same masks are used to mask the GT surface reconstruction and isolate object depth from the background. Hence, segmentation masks indicate the valid pixels (referred to as `D⊙M` in the diagram).\n\n- **Depth Estimation ([mask1])**:  \n  The \"Depth Estimation\" refers to the process of computing per-pixel depth maps, for example, in Near-Infrared (NIR) ToF, Radar (RF ToF), Active Stereo, and Passive Stereo sensors.  \n  Depth estimation takes the raw captured data (signals, or stereo correspondence) and computes depth values per pixel, forming depth maps.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: How does Optical Segmentation utilize Binary Masks for refining Depth Estimation?\n\nThe question asks:  \n*How does **Depth Estimation** ([mask1]) utilize **Optical Segmentation** masks ([mask2]) for refining sensor depth data?*\n\nFrom the context and diagram flow:\n\n- After depth maps are computed by depth estimation from raw sensor signals, segmentation masks derived from optical segmentation are applied as a **mask** to the depth maps.  \n- The segmentation masks serve to **isolate the object of interest** by filtering out depth values from the background or invalid regions. This is critical to ensure that subsequent analyses and comparisons with ground truth refer **only to the object**, not to clutter or background noise.  \n- In the radar context, the segmentation helps restrict the voxel volume during backprojection to the object area to avoid including noise or non-object regions.  \n- For optical sensors, the segmentation mask is multiplied with the depth image (denoted as `D⊙M` in the diagram), effectively zeroing out background pixels and retaining only object pixels with valid depth.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Summary and chain-of-thought conclusion\n\n1. Optical Segmentation produces segmentation masks defining the object region in the RGB image.\n2. These binary masks are applied to the depth maps produced by depth estimation, effectively filtering the object's depth values while excluding background and noise.\n3. This refined depth data is then used for object reconstruction and evaluation.\n4. Thus, segmentation masks from optical segmentation are **utilized as filters or masks** to isolate and refine the sensor's depth values focusing on the object only.\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer:\n\nThe **Depth Estimation** process ([mask1]) uses **Optical Segmentation** masks ([mask2]) by applying these binary masks to the computed depth maps to isolate the object of interest from the background. This masking refines the depth data by restricting valid depth values to only those pixels belonging to the object, thereby improving the accuracy and relevance of depth measurements for reconstruction and evaluation."

This enables the model to dynamically adapt its architecture in response to shifts in data distribution during online continual learning. At each loss plateau, the current LoRA parameters are frozen and merged into the pretrained weights to consolidate prior knowledge, while new trainable LoRA parameters are initialized to learn the new distribution. This dynamic expansion and consolidation strategy allows the model to continuously evolve without explicit knowledge of task boundaries, embodying an efficient and principled form of architectural adaptation."

This corresponds to the upper part of Figure 1 titled \"Importance Score Estimation.\" It covers the Needle-in-a-Haystack test with a question-answer example, explanation of how importance scores are calculated for each head, differentiating between \"context,\" \"reason,\" \"wrong copy,\" \"correct copy,\" tokens, etc.\n\nStep 2: Understand what the question is asking:\n\n\"How does [mask1] integrate [mask2] methodology with contextual reasoning tests?\"\n\nMore specifically,\n\n- [mask2] methodology = Importance Score Estimation as carried out using Needle-in-a-Haystack tests combined with reasoning steps. This methodology assesses the significance of each attention head by measuring attention on the correct inserted answer tokens and reasoning steps.\n\n- [mask1] = Head-Level KV Cache Allocation that uses the importance scores distribution from [mask2] to allocate KV cache budgets dynamically per attention head during the prefill phase.\n\nStep 3: Chain-of-thought reasoning based on the context and image:\n\n1. The blue box ([mask2]) describes a procedure to estimate importance scores for each individual attention head by utilizing tests that combine retrieval of an inserted \"needle\" answer with contextual reasoning steps.\n\n- This method builds on Wu et al. (2024), extending the Needle-in-a-Haystack test by introducing retrieval-reasoning examples where the inserted needle answers have structured parts: a reasoning step and multiple possible answers.\n\n- The importance scores are computed by measuring the attention heads’ focus on tokens of the entire correct answer rather than just the single token with the highest attention. This approach blends retrieval and reasoning abilities.\n\n2. The red box ([mask1]) shows how the result of the importance score estimation ([mask2]) is utilized.\n\n- Using the importance score distribution obtained by the [mask2] method, the system allocates the KV cache budget at the head level rather than only the layer level.\n\n- The allocation breaks the total KV cache budget into basic (fixed) budgets per head and a dynamic shared budget pool.\n\n- The dynamic part is distributed proportionally to the importance scores estimated for each head by the [mask2] method.\n\n- This targeted allocation means more memory is given to heads important for retrieval and reasoning, enabling more efficient and effective KV cache compression.\n\n3. The process also uses the last few instruction tokens (local windows) to guide which KV cache entries to retain, which is consistent with the attention-based importance scores from the [mask2] methodology.\n\nStep 4: Summarize the answer:\n\nThe Head-Level KV Cache Allocation ([mask1]) integrates the Importance Score Estimation methodology ([mask2]) by using the detailed importance scores (computed with the Needle-in-a-Haystack retrieval + reasoning tests) to guide dynamic allocation of KV cache budgets per attention head. This integration ensures that more important heads—those contributing significantly to contextual reasoning and retrieval—are allocated larger KV cache budgets, allowing efficient compression while preserving the contextual reasoning capacity of the model.\n\n# Final answer\n\nThe Head-Level KV Cache Allocation ([mask1]) integrates the Importance Score Estimation methodology ([mask2]) by using the importance scores—calculated via Needle-in-a-Haystack tests enhanced with contextual reasoning steps—to dynamically allocate KV cache budgets for each attention head. Specifically, the importance scores from [mask2] quantify each head’s contribution to both retrieval and reasoning abilities. These scores are then used in [mask1] to proportionally distribute a dynamic KV cache budget pool, alongside a fixed basic budget per head. This integration enables efficient, fine-grained KV cache compression, preserving critical information in heads vital for contextual reasoning tests while reducing memory for less important heads."

There are **Local Windows** (blue squares).  \n    - After compression (bottom), the dynamic budgets are redistributed to heads proportional to their importance scores, resulting in different-sized compressed budgets per head.\n\n- The caption and paragraph describe this as a **head-level allocation versus prior works that mostly use layer-level budget allocation**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Extract key facts from the context relevant to the question\n\n- **Prior methods** for KV cache compression mostly do:  \n  - **Layer-level allocation**, either uniform or dynamic budgets per layer, treating all heads within a layer equally.  \n  - Some methods (e.g., Feng et al.) incorporate head-level info but still rely on **layer-level allocation as a prerequisite**.\n\n- The **proposed method**:  \n  - Estimates **importance scores per head** accurately (not just at layer level).  \n  - Assigns each head a **basic fixed budget** initially.  \n  - Extracts a portion of the total budget from all heads to form a **shared dynamic budget pool**.  \n  - Redistributes this shared budget **proportionally according to importance scores of each head**.  \n  - Final per-head budget = basic fixed budget + dynamic budget from shared pool + last \"τ\" instruct tokens as local windows.  \n  - This achieves more **granular allocation at the head level** rather than equal treatment within layers.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Contrast of Head-Level Allocation vs Dynamic Budget Pooling from prior layer-level methods\n\n| Aspect                     | Prior Layer-Level Dynamic Budget Pooling                   | Proposed Head-Level Allocation (red box)                          |\n|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Allocation granularity** | Allocated at layer level, heads within a layer treated equally | Allocated at the individual head level within all layers          |\n| **Budget allocation**       | Uniform or dynamic budget per layer                        | Basic fixed budget + dynamic budget redistributed per head based on importance scores |\n| **Importance scores**       | May not consider head-level importance or treat all heads equally | Uses detailed head-level importance scores derived from retrieval and reasoning examples |\n| **Dynamic budget pool**     | Created and distributed at the layer level                  | Created by extracting portions from all heads, then redistributed proportionally to heads |\n| **Effectiveness**           | Less fine-grained, can waste budget on less important heads within a layer | More efficient compression and performance by focusing resources on important heads |\n| **Guidance for token selection** | Not explicit in context                                   | Uses last τ instruct tokens as local windows to guide selection locally per head |\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Formulate the final answer\n\nThe **Head-Level KV Cache Allocation** method highlighted in the red box contrasts with prior dynamic budget pooling methods that operate on the layer level by distributing budgets equally or uniformly among heads within a layer. Instead, it leverages head-level importance scores to first assign a basic fixed budget to each head, then creates a shared dynamic budget pool by extracting budget portions from all heads. This shared pool is then redistributed proportionally to each head according to its importance score. This head-level fine-grained allocation allows more efficient use of limited KV cache resources by emphasizing more important heads, unlike prior layer-level methods that allocate budgets more coarsely and treat heads within a layer uniformly.\n\n---\n\n# **Final Answer:**\n\nThe **head-level allocation** highlighted by the red box differs from prior **dynamic budget pooling at the layer level** in that it assigns budgets at the granularity of individual attention heads instead of entire layers. While previous methods uniformly or dynamically allocate budgets per layer treating all heads equally, this method starts with a fixed basic budget per head, extracts a portion from every head to form a shared dynamic budget pool, and then redistributes this pool among heads proportional to their **head-level importance scores**. This approach enables more efficient and precise KV cache compression by focusing resources on the most important heads, leading to more effective memory utilization and performance compared to the coarser, layer-level allocation in prior works."

Inside the red box, there are two sections:  \n   - The top part shows attention heads with their allocated budgets visualized as colored blocks (some solid pink/red blocks and some dashed outlines).  \n   - The bottom part shows budget allocation after a compression step, where the arrangement of budget blocks differs.  \n   \n   The red/pink shading intensity corresponds to the importance score — more crucial heads have darker/redder blocks.\n\n2. **Context from the text on dynamic budget pool**:  \n   The method assigns each head a fixed (basic) KV cache budget initially. To introduce flexibility, they create a dynamic budget pool (denoted as \\(B_{pool}\\)) by carving out a portion of the total budget from all heads. This shared pool is redistributed among heads *proportionally* to their importance scores. Heads with higher importance receive a larger slice of this dynamic pool, increasing their cache budget beyond the basic allocation, while less important heads give up some of their budget to this pool.\n\n3. **How does this improve cache distribution?**  \n   - Instead of equal or rigid budget allocations per head or per layer, the dynamic pool enables fine-grained, adaptive distribution based on actual head importance.  \n   - This approach reduces wasted cache allocation on unimportant heads and increases the capacity dedicated to heads that contribute more to the model’s performance on reasoning and retrieval tasks.  \n   - Furthermore, the \"Prefilling Phrase\" and \"After Compression\" graphics show that after reallocating the dynamic budget, heads with higher importance scores hold more cache entries (more dark red/dashed blocks), indicating a flexible redistribution of cache resources that matches head relevance.\n\n4. **Summary**:  \n   The dynamic budget pool mechanism consolidates some budget from all heads and reallocates it according to importance, which:  \n   - increases KV cache efficiency,  \n   - focuses compute/memory resources on key attention heads, and  \n   - enhances model performance by preserving more relevant KV cache entries.  \n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe dynamic budget pool improves cache distribution across attention heads by pooling a portion of the KV cache budget from all heads and redistributing it proportionally according to each head’s estimated importance score. This enables more critical heads to receive larger KV cache budgets while less important heads get smaller allocations, resulting in a flexible, fine-grained, and more efficient allocation of cache resources that better reflects the heads’ contributions to the model’s reasoning and retrieval abilities."

This historical PRB data is received by the Monitoring System component within the resource provisioning rApp inside the Non-Real Time RIC. The Monitoring System forwards this historical PRB information to the Analytic Engine, where the Predictor resides. The Predictor preprocesses the historical data, performs train-test splitting, and uses the training dataset to train the machine learning models (such as SFF, DeepAR, or Transformer) via AI/ML training processes. This training adjusts the model parameters based on the historical PRB input, enabling the Predictor to generate probabilistic forecasts for future PRB demands.\n\n---\n\n### Final concise answer:\n\nThe Predictor interfaces with historical PRB input during the training phase by receiving PRB data from the Monitoring System, which collects it via the O1 interface from the O-DU. This historical data is preprocessed and split into training sets within the Analytic Engine, enabling the Predictor to train its probabilistic forecasting models using this input to optimize future resource predictions."

The \"APP\" is likely representing the resource provisioning rApp (radio application) that resides within the Non-Real Time RIC in the O-RAN architecture.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding the context of rApp and actuator**  \nFrom the text:  \n- The resource provisioning rApp consists of several components:  \n  - **Monitoring System**: receives historical PRB information from tenants and forwards it within the rApp.  \n  - **Analytical Engine**: pre-processes data, trains models (probabilistic forecasting algorithms like DeepAR, Transformer), and makes predictions giving a range of estimated PRBs with associated probabilities.  \n  - **Decision Engine**: uses the range of predicted PRB values (with associated probabilities) from the predictor and applies decision logic to determine the exact number of PRBs to allocate.  \n  - **Actuator**: then passes this decided number of PRBs as a control command to the O-DU via the O1 interface.\n\n**Step 3: Reasoning about scheduling actuator triggers**  \n- The **predictor** within the Analytical Engine outputs a probabilistic forecast: a range of possible PRB values with their corresponding probabilities.  \n- The **Decision Engine** takes this probabilistic output and, based on some decision-making logic (such as choosing a quantile or applying a threshold related to QoS requirements), selects a precise PRB allocation value out of the predicted range.  \n- This precise PRB value is then given to the **Actuator**.  \n- The Actuator schedules triggers (control commands) by passing the PRB allocation to the O-DU through the O1 interface, effectively provisioning resources for the upcoming time period.\n\n**Step 4: Summary of how the APP schedules actuator triggers**  \nThe rApp (highlighted area) implements a pipeline that converts historical PRB usage data into a probabilistic forecast using AI/ML models. The Decision Engine analyzes this forecast range to decide a suitable exact PRB allocation. The Actuator then schedules triggers based on this decision by sending control signals to the O-DU to allocate the required resources dynamically, ensuring optimized and intelligent resource provisioning.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:  \nThe **resource provisioning rApp** (the highlighted APP area) schedules actuator triggers based on predicted PRB ranges by first using its Analytical Engine to generate probabilistic forecasts of PRB demands from historical data. The Decision Engine then applies decision-making logic to the forecasted range of PRBs, selecting the exact number of PRBs to allocate. Finally, the Actuator issues control commands (actuator triggers) to the O-DU via the O1 interface to allocate the decided PRBs dynamically, thereby enabling intelligent resource provisioning based on probabilistic forecasting."

        "response": "Let's analyze the question step-by-step, aligning the diagram with the textual context and then reasoning about the impact of latency constraints in [mask1] on the efficiency of [mask2].\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify [mask1] (Red Box) and [mask2] (Blue Box) from the Diagram\n\n- **[mask1] (Red Box):**  \n  This box encloses the blocks labeled **O-CU**, **O-SCU**, and **UPF, MEC** inside the \"Cloud Convergence Platform\" (middle-lower part of the diagram).\n\n- **[mask2] (Blue Box):**  \n  This box encloses the rightmost component inside the **Non-Real Time RIC** titled **Resource Provisioning rAPP**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Roles of [mask1] and [mask2] from the Context\n\n**[mask1]: O-CU, O-SCU, UPF, MEC inside Cloud Convergence Platform**\n\n- These represent **Near-Real Time RIC controlled resources** and **cloud/edge computing platforms**:\n  - **O-CU (Open Central Unit)** and **O-SCU (possibly Secondary Central Unit or Service Control Unit)** handle critical real-time RAN functions.\n  - **UPF (User Plane Function)** and **MEC (Multi-Access Edge Computing)** represent the data plane and edge computing resources closer to the user.\n  \n- These are components involved in handling low-latency applications and services, requiring near-real-time responsiveness (latency between 10ms and 1s as per section II).\n\n**[mask2]: Resource Provisioning rAPP in Non-Real Time RIC**\n\n- The **resource provisioning rAPP** is part of Non-Real Time RIC (handles >1s latency).\n- It performs analytics and AI/ML-based forecasting of Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs).\n- It runs probabilistic forecasting models (DeepAR, Transformer) to predict resource demand and decides how many PRBs to allocate.\n- Its decisions are sent via actuators to O-DU using O1 interface, impacting resource allocation at the near-real-time level.\n  \n---\n\n### Step 3: Reasoning About Latency Constraints and Effects\n\n- **Latency Constraints in [mask1] (O-CU, O-SCU, UPF/MEC):**  \n  These components operate with **near-real-time latency constraints (10ms to 1s)** and are responsible for processing and forwarding data with very low delay requirements, supporting URLLC and other latency-sensitive applications.\n\n- **Impact on [mask2] (Resource Provisioning rAPP):**\n\n  1. **Timeliness of Resource Allocation Decisions:**  \n     The rAPP in Non-RT RIC works on longer timescales (coarse-grained data, >1s latency). If latency constraints in [mask1] are very stringent, the resource provisioning decisions taken by rAPP might not be able to react fast enough to rapid changes or spikes in traffic that happens at the near-real-time network elements.\n\n  2. **Efficiency of Resource Provisioning rAPP:**  \n     Since rAPP relies on monitoring historical PRB data and probabilistic forecasting over intervals of minutes to hours (e.g., predicting PRB demand for next 24 hours), a strict low latency environment at [mask1] requires more dynamic, faster reactive mechanisms that rAPP alone might not handle efficiently.\n\n  3. **Reduced Flexibility and Responsiveness:**  \n     High latency constraints at the near-real time components mean resource demands and network states might fluctuate faster than Non-RT RIC's resource provisioning rAPP can update allocations. This leads to potential **inefficiency**, where resources are either over-provisioned or under-provisioned, leading to QoS degradation or resource wastage.\n\n  4. **Need for Complementary Near-Real-Time Control:**  \n     The context mentions the **Near-Real Time RIC** manages fine-grained control via rApps and corresponding interfaces (A1, E2, O1) to handle fast decision-making. Hence, the resource provisioning rAPP (in Non-RT RIC) efficiency is affected by how well the near-real-time components complement the slower Non-RT RIC. If latency constraints at [mask1] are tight, the rAPP's role shifts more towards policy guidance rather than immediate resource allocation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Summarizing the Relationship\n\n- **Latency constraints at [mask1] components (O-CU, O-SCU, UPF/MEC)** require near-real-time processing and quick adaptation to variable traffic and network demands.\n- **The resource provisioning rAPP in [mask2] operates with a higher latency tolerance and relies on probabilistic forecasting to inform resource allocation decisions over longer time scales.**\n- Therefore, **tighter (lower) latency constraints at [mask1] can limit the efficiency of [mask2] rAPP because the rAPP's resource predictions and provisions might be outdated or too coarse-grained for highly dynamic near-real-time needs.**\n- This necessitates coordination with Near-Real Time RIC components or faster mechanisms to maintain network performance and avoid resource allocation inefficiencies.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer:**\n\nLatency constraints in the components within [mask1] (O-CU, O-SCU, UPF, and MEC), which operate with stringent near-real-time requirements (10ms to 1s), directly impact the efficiency of the resource provisioning rAPP in [mask2] located in the Non-Real Time RIC, which works with coarser time granularity (>1s latency). Stringent low latency demands mean that resource allocation decisions predicted and provisioned by the rAPP (which rely on probabilistic forecasting over longer intervals) may not be reactive enough to respond promptly to rapid changes in network conditions at [mask1]. This reduces the efficiency of the rAPP by potentially causing misallocation of PRBs, leading to resource wastage or degraded quality of service. Therefore, latency constraints in [mask1] necessitate complementary near-real-time control mechanisms to support the rAPP's longer-term provisioning, ensuring timely and efficient resource management across the O-RAN architecture."

The Decision Engine and Actuator (red box) take these predictions from the analytic engine and make decisions about resource provisioning, pass commands to O-DU to allocate PRBs.\n\n### Question restated:\n**What ethical risks arise from exposing tenant PRB histories (historical data of resource usage by tenants/users) to the analytic engine (blue box) via the resource provisioning APP (red box)?**\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Tenant PRB histories refer to resource usage patterns per tenant** — how much data/spectrum a particular tenant consumes over time.\n\n2. **Exposing tenant PRB histories to the Analytic Engine (blue box) means feeding sensitive usage data into AI/ML forecasting algorithms that predict future resource needs.**\n\n3. The analytic engine processes historical data to train models, which could potentially reveal detailed information about tenant behavior over time.\n\n4. **Ethical risks related to exposing this data include:**\n\n   - **Privacy Concerns:**  \n     PRB history data can reveal sensitive patterns about tenants’ usage, application types, activity levels, or even user locations indirectly. Such data may be considered personally identifiable or sensitive business information.\n\n   - **Data Confidentiality and Security:**  \n     If data is not properly anonymized or secured, there is a risk of data breaches or unauthorized access leading to leakage of tenant-specific data.\n\n   - **Informed Consent & Transparency:**  \n     Tenants might not be aware or have not explicitly consented to their detailed usage data being processed by third-party or AI/ML components, which raises ethical questions.\n\n   - **Potential for Discrimination or Biased Decisions:**  \n     The predictions from AI models trained on tenant data could be biased or lead to unfair resource allocation. For example, tenants with certain usage patterns might be deprioritized or throttled unfairly.\n\n   - **Data Ownership and Control:**  \n     Ethical question of who owns the PRB history data and whether tenants retain control over how it is used and stored.\n\n5. **Technical aspects**: Since the data is processed as part of the resource provisioning app (rApp) running within O-RAN, which is often cloud-native and may involve third-party vendors, the exposure surface for sensitive data expands.\n\n6. **Related Context:** The context mentions the Network Operator and service providers managing the data, with resource provisioning decisions depending on probabilistic forecasts. This increases dependence on historical data accuracy and integrity.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n**Exposing tenant Physical Resource Block (PRB) histories to the Analytic Engine through the Resource Provisioning APP poses several ethical risks: it can compromise tenant privacy by revealing sensitive usage patterns and potentially personal or business information; it risks data confidentiality if adequate security and anonymization are not ensured; it raises issues regarding informed consent and transparency around data usage; there is potential for AI-driven bias or discrimination in resource allocation; and it introduces concerns about data ownership and tenant control over their information. These risks highlight the importance of strong data protection, transparency, and ethical AI practices in managing and processing tenant PRB histories within cloud-native O-RAN environments.**"

For example, a similarity score of 0.5 might correspond to different percentile rankings in different modalities. So, the first stage calibration converts these similarity scores in each cross-modal space into conformal probabilities. This means the scores are *calibrated individually per modality* to be on the same probability scale ([0,1]) reflecting the likelihood of correct retrieval.  \n  This grounding to a common scale addresses *incomparability within matrices* of similarity scores from different modalities.\n\n- **Second stage calibration:**  \n  After the first stage, for a given query and a candidate reference instance, we have a *matrix* of probabilities representing each modality's conformal probability. But for retrieval, we need a *single scalar score* per candidate to be able to rank the candidates easily.  \n  The second stage takes this probability matrix and applies a mapping function (like the mean over non-missing entries) to convert it to a scalar, and then uses conformal calibration again to ensure this scalar reflects a statistically valid probability of correct retrieval.  \n  This allows the framework to *fuse information across multiple modalities* and compare retrieved instances on a unified scalar scale.\n\n**Step 3: Motivation for separating the two stages**  \n- The **motivation for the first stage** is to convert diverse modality similarity scores, initially incomparable, into calibrated probabilities on the same scale. This enables arithmetic operations like averaging in the second stage.  \n- The **motivation for the second stage** is to consolidate the multi-modal probability matrix into a single scalar that can be compared across candidates and queries, enabling *ranking and retrieval*.  \n- Together, they ensure a robust, theoretically guaranteed way to handle multiple incomplete modalities with calibrated probabilities.\n\n**Step 4: Summarize succinctly**  \nThe separation is motivated by the need to first normalize modality-specific similarity scores independently to a common probability scale (1st stage), and then combine these normalized scores into a unified scalar probability for retrieval decisions (2nd stage). Without this two-stage calibration, scores across modalities cannot be fairly compared or aggregated, undermining retrieval performance and theoretical guarantees.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe first stage calibration is motivated by the need to convert heterogeneous and incomparable similarity scores from different modality pairs into conformal probabilities on a common scale, enabling meaningful comparison within modality-specific feature spaces. The second stage calibration is motivated by the need to fuse these modality-wise probability matrices into a single scalar probability that facilitates direct comparison and ranking of retrieval candidates across all modalities. Separating the two stages allows the framework to first standardize scores per modality and then aggregate them reliably, ensuring robust, statistically guaranteed retrieval despite incomplete and varying modalities."

Why is this transformation necessary before fusion?\n   - Since similarity scores from different modality pairs have different distributions and ranges, simply fusing or averaging them (as raw scores) would be invalid and misleading.\n   - Converting them into a unified probability metric ensures that probabilities reflect comparable confidence levels of correct matching.\n   - This makes fusion (summarizing or aggregating conformal matrices into a scalar) mathematically and statistically principled.\n   - The second stage calibration then combines these calibrated values into an overall scalar probability that can be used to compare reference instances reliably.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\nThe raw cross-modal similarity scores highlighted by [mask1] are not directly comparable across different modality pairs because they have different ranges and distributions produced by diverse encoders. Transforming these scores into conformal probabilities ([mask2]) via the first stage calibration standardizes them onto a common probability scale. This makes the individual scores statistically comparable, enabling effective and meaningful fusion into an overall calibrated probability.

This enforces the model to learn richer, less biased features that cover various random parts of the pedestrian’s body, thereby alleviating the impact of objective factors like pose variation, occlusion, and camera angle. Consequently, this reduces feature bias and improves model robustness in cloth-changing person ReID scenarios.\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe Dual-length Hybrid Patch (DHP) module is employed for bias mitigation because it enhances feature diversity and coverage by shuffling and grouping patch embeddings into multiple local fine-grained features with dual-length (dense and sparse) coverage. This operation allows the model to extract features from random patches of different body parts, combining local and global information. Such diverse multi-length patch features help to balance and alleviate the feature bias caused by pedestrian posture, occlusion, and shooting angle, thus improving the robustness of identity recognition in cloth-changing person ReID."

Now, let's reason step-by-step how the CIS module optimizes learnable prompt tokens to align clothing image and text embeddings:\n\n1. **Role of CIS Module**:  \n   The CIS module aims to decouple redundant visual information in the image related to clothing and establish a robust correspondence between clothing images and textual descriptions. This helps reduce the negative impact of clothing variability on cloth-changing person ReID.\n\n2. **Learnable Text Prompts**:  \n   - The CIS module introduces a set of **learnable text prompt tokens** for each identity and clothing item.  \n   - There are two types of text prompts:  \n     - Identity-dependent prompt: \"A photo of a [identity] person.\"  \n     - Clothes-dependent prompt: \"A photo of a [clothing] clothes.\"  \n   - Each prompt consists of multiple learnable tokens (dimensions match embedded words).\n\n3. **Two-Stage Training in CIS**:  \n   **Stage 1:**  \n   - The image encoder and text encoder parameters are **frozen**.  \n   - The system optimizes only the learnable prompt tokens (identity prompt and clothes prompt).  \n   - Using frozen encoders (pre-trained by CLIP), text features and image features are extracted:  \n     - \\( F^{text}_{ori} \\), \\( F^{text}_{clo} \\) from text encoder  \n     - \\( F^{img}_{ori} \\), \\( F^{img}_{clo} \\) from image encoder  \n   - A **contrastive learning loss** aligns the visual embeddings with the corresponding text embeddings in both directions: image-to-text and text-to-image. This loss aligns the clothing image embeddings and the textual prompt embeddings, encouraging the learned prompts to better represent the identity and clothing features.  \n   - This stage effectively \"pre-trains\" the text prompts to accurately represent identities and clothing items in textual form aligned with visual features.\n\n   **Stage 2:**  \n   - The text encoder and the trained prompt tokens from stage 1 are now **frozen**.  \n   - Only the image encoder is fine-tuned.  \n   - The frozen text embeddings act as guidance to align image features with identity and clothing semantic spaces.  \n   - A **clothing stripping loss** guides the image encoder to strip out clothing-related information from the identity representation, using the prompts as robust reference points.  \n   - Additional losses like spatial consistency loss regularize clothing and image embeddings into a unified space.\n\n4. **Contrastive Loss Details**:  \n   - The contrastive loss in stage 1 computes similarity scores (inner product) between image features and text features and aims to maximize similarity for matched pairs (same person or clothing) and reduce for mismatches in the batch.  \n   - Separate losses for identity and clothing embeddings are combined.\n\n5. **Summary**:  \n   - Through stage 1, the CIS module uses **contrastive learning** to optimize the learnable prompt tokens for identity and clothing.  \n   - The frozen CLIP-based encoders extract embeddings from clothing images and textual prompts, and the learnable tokens are adapted to maximize correspondence between these embeddings.  \n   - This process aligns clothing images and text embeddings into a shared space by optimizing the textual prompts, providing precise semantic guidance for downstream tasks like clothing information stripping.\n\n**Final Answer**:  \nThe Clothing Information Stripping (CIS) module optimizes learnable prompt tokens by introducing identity-dependent and clothes-dependent text prompts, which are learned through contrastive learning. In the first training stage, with frozen image and text encoders, the model optimizes these text prompts so that their embeddings align closely with the corresponding clothing image embeddings. This alignment is enforced by a contrastive loss that maximizes similarity between matched image-text pairs and minimizes it for mismatched pairs. As a result, the prompts become uniquely tuned to represent different identities and clothing items, enabling precise guidance for decoupling clothing information from the visual features in later stages."

The weighted result is then added element-wise back to the original features to obtain enhanced features \\( F_{enh}^{img} \\).

This is crucial because the inverse problem:\n\n  - is often ill-posed,\n  - may be noisy,\n  - and may have multiple solutions.\n\n- Priors based on **sparsity** mean that the solution \\( X \\) is expected to have few nonzero elements — e.g., the underlying image or signal is compressible or has a sparse representation in some basis. This is related to compressed sensing and regularization techniques like \\(\\ell_1\\)-norm minimization.\n\n- Priors based on **complexity** imply that the solution has low complexity, which could mean smoothness, low-rank structure, or other notions that reduce the \"degrees of freedom\" effectively. This is often represented with \\(\\ell_2\\)-type regularizations or other constraints that encourage smooth or \"simple\" solutions.\n\n- As per the text under section **III End-to-end (inverse) design of computational metaoptics:**\n\n  - \"The regularized regression enforces explicit conditions on \\(X\\), such as uniqueness, stability, smoothness, non-negativity, and/or sparsity, and can be handled by conventional iterative algorithms with provable convergence and correctness.\"\n  \n- The diagram in Figure 1c symbolically visualizes these two different priors as geometric constraints in the space of possible solutions to the least-square problem.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: How are these priors integrated into the least-square reconstruction algorithm?\n\n- The priors are incorporated as **penalty terms (regularizers)** in the cost function minimized by the algorithms.\n\n- Mathematically, if the measurement model is:\n  \\[\n  Y = A X + \\text{noise}\n  \\]\n  \n  The least-square reconstruction typically solves:\n  \\[\n  \\hat{X} = \\arg\\min_X \\| A X - Y \\|^2_2 + \\lambda R(X)\n  \\]\n  \n  Where:\n  - \\(\\| A X - Y \\|^2_2\\) is the data fidelity term,\n  - \\(R(X)\\) is a regularization function encoding priors,\n  - \\(\\lambda\\) controls the strength of the prior.\n  \n- For **sparsity**, \\(R(X)\\) might be \\(\\|X\\|_1\\) (the sum of absolute values), encouraging solutions with fewer nonzero components.\n\n- For **complexity**, \\(R(X)\\) might be \\(\\|X\\|^2_2\\) or total variation norms or other complexity-reducing terms that encourage smoothness, low-rank approximation, or simpler structure.\n\n- By including these priors (sparsity or complexity), the solution space is constrained accordingly, improving reconstruction especially under noise or incompleteness.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Answer:**\n\n**Sparsity and complexity priors are integrated into least-square reconstruction algorithms as regularization terms that constrain the solution space. Sparsity priors impose that the reconstructed degrees of freedom are mostly zero or have few nonzero elements (e.g., promoting compressed sensing), while complexity priors encourage solutions with simple or smooth structures. These priors modify the least-square cost function by adding penalty terms, leading to regularized optimization problems that enforce the desired properties during the reconstruction of the incident light’s degrees of freedom.**\n\n---\n\n### Additional note on Figure 1c:\n\n- The schematic uses geometric shapes to represent regions allowed by the priors: \n  - Sparsity corresponds to the diamond shape (red), favoring solutions with few components.\n  - Complexity corresponds to a circular region (cyan), favoring simpler structured solutions.\n  \n- This conceptual visualization shows how priors restrict the feasible solution to subsets of the entire DOF space, enhancing reconstruction quality beyond pure least squares.\n\n---\n\n**Therefore, the integration of sparsity and complexity priors in least-square reconstruction algorithms happens through the addition of prior-informed regularization terms that guide the optimization towards desired solutions, improving robustness, resolution, and interpretability of the reconstructed image or signal in computational metaoptic imaging.**"

This physically encoded frequency-dependent information significantly enhances the distinguishability of spectral components in the measured data, thereby informing and facilitating Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) algorithms. Consequently, MLE can more accurately reconstruct the frequency degrees of freedom from the dispersed measurement data, leveraging the spectral dispersion engineered by the metasurface to achieve robust and precise frequency reconstruction."

Build Text-to-Code Prompts (green box)  \n  2. Build Code-to-Code Prompts (orange box)  \n\n- The \"Prompt Template Design\" step feeds into \"Data Collection\" then \"Prompt Construction\" before outputting prompt datasets like T2C-L1, T2C-L2, T2C-L3, CC, and CT (code completion and code translation).\n\n- This indicates that **Prompt Template Design is an essential first step in constructing the complete prompts, including those for code translation.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: What is the role of \"Prompt Template Design\" according to the context?\n\nFrom Section 3.1, 3.3, and especially 3.3.2 (Code Translation Prompts) in the context:  \n\n- Code Translation Prompts consist of a complete malicious code snippet, an original programming language, a target programming language, and instructions to translate the code.\n\n- These prompt templates are designed by referring to prior works (e.g., EgoAlpha's prompt in-context learning).\n\n- The prompt template includes placeholders for malicious code and language specifics:\n\n  > Specifically, `{malicious code}`, `{original language}`, and `{target language}` are filled in the template.\n\n- The choice of target language is dictated by a rule (Python ↔ JavaScript, non-Python → Python).\n\n- This template design is essential to standardize inputs for LLMs and enable them to understand the task clearly — i.e., to translate the malicious code correctly.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: What is the role of **in-context learning strategies** in shaping this?\n\n- In-context learning is a method where the LLM is given examples or context to help it perform a task better without fine-tuning.\n\n- According to the context, for Code Completion prompts, placeholders `<FILL_HERE>` are added to help the model locate where completion is required.\n\n- For Code Translation, the prompt-in-context learning approach from EgoAlpha is also used as a reference, indicating the templates benefit from context-aware prompt design.\n\n- Proper prompt templates, enhanced with in-context examples or well-structured instructions, help LLMs better comprehend the task they need to perform.\n\n- This means, in code translation, **in-context learning shapes prompt template design by informing how to construct the prompt structure, placing malicious code and instructions, and choosing languages to optimize the language model's ability to interpret and complete the translation task, especially in recognizing malicious intent and refusing harmful outputs.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Summarize the reasoning and answer\n\n**In summary:**  \n- \"Prompt Template Design\" (the masked content) fundamentally involves designing structured prompts with placeholders and instructions.  \n- In-context learning strategies influence this design by guiding how prompts are composed, including examples, placeholders, and clear instructions to enable LLMs to perform code translation effectively.  \n- For Code Translation in RMCBench, this results in prompts that explicitly include malicious code, specify languages, and instruct translation — making use of template structures that leverage in-context learning to improve the model’s capacity to handle malicious code translation tasks.\n\n---\n\n# Final Answer:\n\nIn-context learning strategies shape **\"Prompt Template Design\"** for Code Translation scenarios by guiding the construction of structured prompts that clearly incorporate malicious code snippets, specify original and target programming languages, and provide explicit translation instructions. These strategies help define templates that include context cues, placeholders, and instructions that enable large language models to understand and perform the code translation tasks effectively, particularly in recognizing and handling malicious content."

Build Text-to-Code Prompts\" section.\n\nStep 2: Understand the roles of these two components from the context.\n\n- **Prompt Template Design ([mask1])**:  \n  According to Section 3.1 in the context, the first step in constructing RMCBench is \"Prompt Template Design,\" where specific prompt templates are designed for each task (text-to-code or code-to-code). This involves designing the structure and content format of prompts to effectively create malicious code generation requests to LLMs.\n\n- **Level 3 Prompts ([mask2])**:  \n  From Section 3.2.2, Level 3 prompts are built on Level 2 prompts but enhanced by adding jailbreak templates. These are more challenging prompts that combine jailbreak attack templates with the descriptions used in Level 2 prompts, designed to circumvent LLM safety measures and cause them to generate malicious code by evading detection.\n\nStep 3: How does \"Prompt Template Design\" adapt to integrate \"Level 3 Prompts\"?\n\n- From the text:\n\n  - Level 3 prompts are constructed by combining jailbreak templates (collected from jailbreakchat.com) with Level 2 prompts to create more complex adversarial prompts.\n  - Since many jailbreak templates are designed for ChatGPT specifically, they require **modification** to fit other LLMs, e.g., changing salutations from \"Hi, ChatGPT,\" to \"Hi, Llama…\" for compatibility and clarity during testing.\n  - This adaptation in prompt templates ensures that the jailbreak attack templates are seamlessly fused with Level 2 descriptions while adjusting for LLM-specific identities.\n  - The result is a comprehensive Level 3 prompt that contains both the jailbreak template (an adversarial exploit) and the original Level 2 prompt, making the test more adversarial and difficult for LLMs to defend against.\n\nStep 4: Summarize how \"Prompt Template Design\" adapts for integrating Level 3 Prompts.\n\n- The prompt template design process incorporates modifications to jailbreak templates originally intended for a specific model (ChatGPT) to generalize them for other LLMs.\n- It connects (integrates) the jailbreak templates with Level 2 prompt content to form Level 3 prompts.\n- This integration involves editing salutations, ensuring prompt consistency, and combining two prompt components for effective adversarial testing.\n- The adaptation thus enhances adversarial testing by combining jailbreak techniques with subtler malicious descriptions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe **\"Prompt Template Design\"** ([mask1]) adapts to integrate **\"Level 3 Prompts\"** ([mask2]) by modifying and combining jailbreak templates with Level 2 prompt templates. Specifically, since many jailbreak templates are originally designed for ChatGPT, the prompt templates are adjusted (e.g., changing salutations like \"Hi, ChatGPT\" to \"Hi, Llama\") to align with different LLMs under test. This adaptation ensures consistency across models and effectively fuses jailbreak attack components with functional malicious descriptions from Level 2 prompts. By integrating these elements, the prompt template design creates comprehensive Level 3 adversarial prompts that more effectively test LLMs' robustness against generating malicious code under jailbreak conditions."

These perturbations are added to the original latent representation \\( E_p \\) to produce a fair representation. The generator is trained adversarially against a discriminator \\( D \\) that tries to detect sensitive attributes, so \\( G \\) learns to erase such information. Simultaneously, the perturbations are regulated so as not to reduce the classification utility, by considering the loss over the task-specific classifier \\( F_\\theta \\). Thus, \\( G \\) produces perturbations that remove bias while preserving classification performance.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\nThe Generator (highlighted by the red box) takes as input the semantic-rich sequence outputs (highlighted by the blue box) and generates fairness-aware perturbations. By leveraging the detailed semantic information encoded in the sequence outputs, the generator creates perturbation masks that, when added to the latent pooled representation, erase sensitive attribute information to reduce bias. At the same time, it preserves the classification utility by being optimized adversarially to fool the sensitive attribute discriminator while maintaining low classification loss on the downstream task. This adversarial training ensures the perturbations eliminate bias but retain the original semantic features essential for accurate classification."

This perturbation is added to the original latent representation \\( z \\) (hidden state of [CLS]) to produce a debiased/fair representation \\( z' = z + \\eta \\).\n\n- **Discriminator (D)**:  \n  Receives either the original latent representation \\( z \\) (real) or the perturbed representation \\( z' \\) (adversarial), and attempts to predict the sensitive attribute \\( s \\) (e.g., gender, race).  \n  D's goal is to correctly distinguish the sensitive attribute based on these representations.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: The adversarial training setup\n\n- The interaction between Generator \\( G \\) and Discriminator \\( D \\) forms an adversarial game (GAN-style):\n  - **D tries to correctly predict sensitive attributes from \\( z' \\)**.\n  - **G tries to produce perturbations \\( \\eta \\) such that \\( z' \\) “obscures” or removes sensitive attribute signals**, making it hard for D to correctly predict \\( s \\).\n\n- The objective for:\n  - **D**: Maximize ability to predict \\( s \\) from \\( z' \\).\n  - **G**: Minimize D's ability to predict \\( s \\) from \\( z' \\), while preserving the semantic integrity and classification utility of the representation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: How feedback from D refines G's perturbations\n\n- Because \\( G \\) and \\( D \\) are adversaries, \\( D \\) provides feedback in the form of a loss signal indicating how distinguishable the sensitive attribute signals are in \\( z' \\).\n\n- When \\( D \\) is able to correctly predict \\( s \\) from \\( z' \\), this feedback signals \\( G \\) that the current perturbations \\( \\eta \\) are insufficient to remove sensitive information.\n\n- \\( G \\) uses this feedback (the discriminator loss gradient) to adjust how it generates perturbations, learning to better mask or remove sensitive attribute cues.\n\n- This iterative adversarial training leads to \\( G \\) refining perturbations that progressively obscure sensitive attribute signals more effectively, until \\( D \\) can no longer distinguish \\( s \\) reliably.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Ensuring task utility during the feedback loop\n\n- Importantly, \\( G \\) also learns perturbations that do **not harm the representation’s usefulness** for the downstream classification task.\n\n- So the feedback to \\( G \\) includes balancing both:\n  - **Minimizing sensitive attribute leakage (from D)**\n  - **Maximizing classification accuracy (from classifier \\( F_\\theta \\))**\n\n---\n\n### Final Chain-of-Thought Answer:\n\nThe **feedback from the Discriminator (D)** refines the **Generator's (G)** perturbations by providing a loss signal that reflects how well the perturbed representations \\( z' \\) still reveal sensitive attribute information. If \\( D \\) can successfully predict sensitive attributes from \\( z' \\), this signals to \\( G \\) that its current perturbations are ineffective at obscuring sensitive signals. Using adversarial training, \\( G \\) uses gradients derived from \\( D \\)’s predictions to adjust and improve its perturbations, making them more semantic and fairness-aware so they better mask sensitive attributes while preserving task-relevant features. Over iterations, this adversarial feedback loop enables \\( G \\) to progressively generate perturbations that effectively erase sensitive information from latent representations, thus reducing bias in downstream predictions.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Answer:\n\nFeedback from the **Discriminator (D)** provides a supervisory signal to the **Generator (G)** indicating how distinguishable the sensitive attributes are in the perturbed representation. This feedback guides \\( G \\) to iteratively refine its perturbations so that the sensitive attribute signals become increasingly obscured, making it harder for \\( D \\) to predict sensitive attributes while still maintaining the semantic integrity and classification utility of the representations."

Understand what each component represents based on the diagram and text:\n\n   - **Generator (G)**:\n     - It is a component that takes the sequence outputs \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) from the pretrained BERT and generates a fairness-aware perturbation mask \\(\\boldsymbol{\\delta}\\).\n     - The generator is implemented with a simple structure to facilitate training convergence.\n     - Its training objective involves making it hard for the discriminator \\(D\\) to predict sensitive attributes, while preserving semantic and classification utility.\n   \n   - **Semantic & fairness-aware perturbation (blue box)**:\n     - This includes the generator and the subsequent processes of adding the generated perturbation \\(\\boldsymbol{\\delta}\\) to the original latent representation \\(\\mathbf{L}\\), producing a perturbed latent representation \\(\\mathbf{L}' = \\mathbf{L} + \\boldsymbol{\\delta}\\).\n     - The goal is to erase or mask the sensitive attributes embedded in \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) without harming the semantics important for the downstream tasks.\n     - This perturbation is then used as input to both the discriminator \\(D\\) (which tries to detect sensitive attributes) and the classifier \\(F_{\\theta}\\) (which predicts the main task labels).\n     - The perturbations are \"semantic and fairness-aware\" because they are designed adversarially to both hide sensitive attributes and preserve semantic classification utility.\n\n3. What limitations does the **Generator (G)** encounter in generating the **Semantic & fairness-aware perturbation**?\n\n   By analyzing the text and framework, the possible limitations / challenges faced by the generator include:\n\n   - **Balancing fairness and utility**:\n     - The generator must create perturbations that hide sensitive information well enough to fool the discriminator but also preserve the semantic information so that the classifier's accuracy is not degraded.\n     - This involves a delicate trade-off; too strong perturbation can damage the model performance, too weak perturbation fails to mitigate bias.\n\n   - **Training complexity and convergence**:\n     - The text mentions the generator is implemented by a simple structure \"to reduce the complexity of convergence\" during training. This implies that a more complex generator could be more effective but harder to train.\n     - The adversarial training is inherently challenging due to the mini-max game dynamics in GANs (generator vs discriminators).\n\n   - **Transferability issues**:\n     - While adversarial training creates perturbations effective on the original model during training, those perturbations may not transfer perfectly to other models or tasks unless explicitly verified.\n     - The generator's capacity to generalize perturbations beyond the trained scenario may be limited.\n\n   - **Semantic preservation difficulty**:\n     - Since the perturbations are applied to hidden states (representations), there’s an inherent difficulty in ensuring that sensitive attributes are erased without unintentionally modifying task-relevant semantic features.\n\n   - **Dependence on quality of representation**:\n     - The generator’s input is the sequence output \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) of BERT. If \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) embeds sensitive information strongly, the generator must produce appropriately strong perturbations, a challenge especially if sensitive features are deeply entangled with semantics.\n\n4. Summary:\n\n   - The generator G's main limitation in generating semantic & fairness-aware perturbations is to **effectively erase sensitive information while preserving semantic and task-related information**, a challenging trade-off that constrains the strength and nature of perturbations it can produce.\n\n   - Further, due to adversarial training’s instability and balancing multiple objectives (fooling discriminator vs preserving classifier accuracy), optimizing the generator is inherently difficult.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe generator ([mask1]) encounters the limitation of having to carefully balance generating perturbations that effectively remove or mask sensitive attribute information without degrading the semantic content and classification utility of the latent representations. This trade-off makes it challenging to produce semantic and fairness-aware perturbations ([mask2]) that simultaneously fool the discriminator into failing to predict sensitive attributes while preserving the necessary information for the downstream classification task. Additionally, the adversarial training dynamics and the simplicity of the generator’s structure to facilitate convergence further constrain its ability to generate optimal perturbations."

The GIE module involves walking on large user-author and author-author graphs to generate metapath-guided neighbors.\n2. Doing this \"walking on the graph\" dynamically in online inference can impose **significant computational overhead** and **cause time delays**.\n3.

This design choice supports system efficiency and meets **low latency requirements** for real-time serving.\n\n### From above, the motivation for decoupling the graph-based behavior expansion from the online MFQ module is:\n- To reduce computational overhead\n- To decrease serving latency/time delays\n- To avoid walking the graph online\n- To enable efficient and scalable online inference by relying on offline pre-computation\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\nThe motivation for decoupling the Graph-guided Interest Expansion (GIE) module (highlighted in red) from the online MFQ module is to avoid the significant computational overhead and latency caused by dynamically walking the large user-author and author-author graphs during online inference. By performing the behavior expansion offline and storing the pre-aggregated metapath-guided neighbors, the online recommendation model can efficiently retrieve the expanded behavior sequences without expensive graph traversal, thus meeting the low latency requirements of the real-time online serving system."

Identification of [mask1] and [mask2]:\n   - The red box ([mask1]) encloses the \"Structured\" historical events input, which includes graph-sub-events and associated images.\n   - The blue box ([mask2]) encloses the \"Unstructured\" historical events input, which includes text-sub-events and associated images.\n\n2. From the context (Section 3.1 Problem Formulation):\n   - Structured representation models events as graphs (event graphs with quadruples/quintuples).\n   - Unstructured representation models historical events as textual sub-events summarizing news articles.\n   - Both types of input have associated images.\n\n3. Motivation for supporting both types:\n   - The paper explicitly states that the forecast task involves multimodal inputs and different data representations to better capture the complexity of temporal events.\n   - Structured event forecasting captures discrete, formal event relationships in a graph structure.\n   - Unstructured event forecasting captures narrative textual information from news summaries.\n   - Images provide complementary visual information that can highlight or supplement key event details.\n\n4. From Section 3.2 (Image Function Identification):\n   - Images (associated with either structured or unstructured data) serve important functions for enhancing the understanding of historical events.\n   - Recognizing image functions as highlighting or complementary enhances the multimodal integration.\n\n5. From Section 3.3 (Forecasting Framework):\n   - The forecasting framework leverages both structured and unstructured event representations to build input contexts.\n   - The model utilizes key events and complementary events extracted with image functions for robust event forecasting.\n   - The framework is versatile and compatible with popular LLM-based methods (ICL and RAG) to handle both input formats.\n\nSummary Interpretation:\nThe motivation behind supporting both **structured** and **unstructured** historical events inputs is to leverage the complementary strengths of different data representations: structured data provides formally organized, graph-based event relationships while unstructured data offers narrative textual summaries. Together with associated images, this multimodal approach produces a more comprehensive understanding of historical events, enabling better temporal event forecasting outcomes.\n\nFinal Answer:\nSupporting both **structured** and **unstructured** historical events input is motivated by the need to comprehensively represent historical information. Structured inputs capture discrete, graph-based event relationships, while unstructured inputs provide textual summaries capturing narrative context. Combined with images serving as highlighting or complementary functions, this multimodal integration enriches the information context and improves the accuracy and robustness of temporal event forecasting."

        "response": "Let's systematically analyze and reason to answer the question:\n\n---\n\n**Question Recap:**  \nHow does the hierarchical interaction between the [mask1] and [mask2] policies reflect established hierarchical reinforcement learning methodologies?\n\n- **[mask1]** = the content highlighted by the red box in the image.  \n- **[mask2]** = the content highlighted by the blue box in the image.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify the content of [mask1] and [mask2]\n\n**From the image and context:**\n\n- The red box ([mask1]) highlights the **High-Level** block with the description:  \n  \"Observing the environment and making quick decisions\"\n\n- The blue box ([mask2]) highlights the **Mid-Level** block with the description:  \n  \"Coordinate limbs and generate various movement patterns\"\n\nThis exactly matches the textual description in Figure 1b and the corresponding parts in the context section.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Understand the hierarchical policies in the framework\n\n- The **High-Level Policy (red box)** is a decision-making neural network taking environmental inputs and robot proprioception to output high-level actions.  \n- The **Mid-Level Policy (blue box)** is a skill-driven neural network controlling oscillation parameters of the rhythmic CPG to generate coordinated motor skills.\n\nTogether:  \n- High-Level policy makes strategic decisions based on environment (e.g., which skill to execute).  \n- Mid-Level policy translates these high-level commands (skills) into rhythmic motor patterns for actual locomotion.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Examine the corresponding methodology and context description\n\nFrom the \"Skill learning of the mid-level controller\" and \"Multi-task reinforcement learning of the high-level controller\" sections:\n\n- The **mid-level controller** uses an unsupervised reinforcement learning method to learn various motor skills based on oscillator parameter tuning. It outputs skill vectors that shape gait patterns and limb coordination. It is trained once and then fixed.\n\n- The **high-level controller** is trained on top of the fixed mid-level, taking environment observations and proprioception to select skill vectors (i.e., abstract commands) to achieve goal-directed behavior across multiple tasks. Its action frequency is lower (time abstraction).\n\n- Distillation learning later lets the high-level controller predict environment features directly from vision.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Alignment with hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) theory\n\n**Key features of HRL:**  \n1. Hierarchical decompositions of control tasks, separating high-level decision making from low-level motor execution.  \n2. Use of temporally abstract actions (skills or options) that the high-level controller selects.  \n3. Mid-level policies learn reusable skills or options independent of specific tasks.  \n4. High-level policies choose skills that the lower-level policies execute, enabling modular, sample-efficient learning.  \n5. Training often involves pre-training low-level policies (skill discovery) before training high-level policies with environmental feedback.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: How the proposed approach embodies these HRL properties:\n\n- The **mid-level controller** corresponds to a **skill or option policy**, trained via unsupervised RL to maximize skill diversity and dynamic performance. It represents temporally extended low-level behaviors producing rhythmic gait patterns.\n\n- The **high-level controller** corresponds to a **controller over skills**, trained on multiple environment tasks to select skill vectors (abstracted actions) to achieve navigation tasks. It operates at a lower frequency (lower action frequency), reflecting temporal abstraction.\n\n- High-level policy receives environmental inputs and outputs the skill vector that the mid-level policy executes — exactly mirroring HRL frameworks where the higher-level policy selects among learned options.\n\n- This hierarchical decomposition improves learning efficiency, robustness, and generalization, as mid-level skills can be reused across tasks, and high-level policy can learn task structure.\n\n- The decomposition is inspired by neuroscience, where high-level brain areas plan and mid-level areas coordinate limb movements, reflecting biological plausibility.\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\n\nThe hierarchical interaction between the **High-Level policy (red box)** and the **Mid-Level policy (blue box)** reflects classical hierarchical reinforcement learning methodologies by:\n\n- Utilizing a **two-layer hierarchy** where the **low-frequency high-level policy** observes the environment and decides **which skill vector to execute**, effectively selecting among temporally extended options.\n\n- The **mid-level policy acts as a skill executor**, generating coordinated rhythmic motor commands given the high-level skill vector input, functioning as a pre-trained skill module.\n\n- This structure leverages **temporal abstraction**, **skill reuse**, and **sample efficiency**, core principles of HRL, enabling the agent to decompose complex locomotion and navigation into manageable subtasks.\n\n---\n\n### **Answer:**\n\nThe hierarchical interaction between the **High-Level** policy (highlighted by the red box) and the **Mid-Level** policy (highlighted by the blue box) embodies a classical hierarchical reinforcement learning framework where the high-level policy operates at a lower temporal resolution to observe the environment and select among abstract skill vectors or options. These skill vectors serve as high-level commands that the mid-level policy executes by generating coordinated rhythmic locomotion patterns through the central pattern generator (CPG) module.\n\nThe mid-level policy is pre-trained in an unsupervised manner to discover diverse motor skills, effectively acting as temporally extended, reusable options. The high-level policy, trained on multiple tasks, learns to sequence and select these skills based on environmental cues and robot proprioception to accomplish complex navigation and obstacle-crossing tasks.\n\nThis hierarchical decomposition enables temporal abstraction—where the high-level controller commands skills that unfold over multiple time steps—and skill reuse, significantly improving learning efficiency and robustness. The approach aligns closely with established HRL methodologies, where a hierarchy is employed to break down complex control into strategic decision-making (high-level) and skill execution (mid-level), facilitating modular and scalable learning.\n\n---\n\nThis directly answers how the hierarchical interaction between the high-level and mid-level policies reflects classical HRL approaches."

Unlike classical CPG models that directly add external feedback and coupling terms to single-phase dynamics—leading to oscillator failure when feedback signals hit boundary values—this design decouples the oscillator's natural frequency from external inputs to maintain a positive, stable oscillation frequency. This internal regulation guarantees continuous periodic gait signals, thereby improving robustness and the reliability of the generated tripod gait rhythms for robotic locomotion.\n\n---\n\n# Final Answer\n\nThe oscillator design within the low-level CPG module (red box), specifically the Oscillator (RG) (blue box), builds upon classical central pattern generator models by using Hopf oscillator differential equations that internally compute and regulate natural amplitude and frequency to ensure stable and positive oscillations. Unlike classical models that directly add external feedback signals and coupling terms to single-phase derivatives—sometimes causing the oscillator to fail when feedback values reach boundaries—this design ensures the oscillator frequency remains always positive and periodic.

From the diagram and context, the red box shows the process where a pre-trained source ANN model (with ReLU activation layers and frozen layers) is converted to an SNN model (with spiking layers replacing some layers, and most layers frozen except for partial parameters). Below this, the online adaptation mechanism performs partial parameters fine-tuning along with unsupervised loss over multiple time steps.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Conversion from ANN to SNN model:** The source model is a pretrained ANN with ReLU activations. Using equations (6)–(10) and the ANN-SNN conversion methods described, the ANN weights are mapped to SNN weights using a weight mapping process (red solid arrows in the diagram). This conversion leverages the equivalence between normalized ReLU activation and the firing rates of IF spiking neurons.\n\n2. **Partial parameter fine-tuning:** In the online adaptation phase (lower half of the figure), the converted SNN model is composed of spiking layers (blue boxes) and ReLU activation layers (grey boxes). Most layers, especially their core weights, are frozen (black lock icons), while only small portions of parameters (e.g., affine parameters of normalization layers and the introduced clip parameters for adaptive activation scaling) are marked as \"gradient enabled\" (open lock icons) and updated online.\n\n3. **Unsupervised loss over multiple time steps:** The SNN outputs spikes over multiple discrete time steps (t=1 to T). The network accumulates output over these steps. An unsupervised loss (entropy loss) computed on these outputs guides the adaptation without requiring labeled data, enabling online adaptation to the test data's domain shift.\n\n4. **Supporting partial fine-tuning alongside unsupervised loss:** The use of the converted SNN structure (from \"Conversion to SNN\") allows retaining most learned weights while only tuning partial parameters (normalization affine parameters, clip parameters for activation scaling) efficiently via an unsupervised entropy loss computed at each time step (instantaneous entropy loss). The partial fine-tuning reduces computational burden and memory cost compared to full BPTT training of all weights, as discussed in the context, which is crucial for online, on-device adaptation.\n\nHence, the red box labeled \"[mask1]\" representing the \"Conversion to SNN\" supports partial parameter fine-tuning by:\n\n- Providing a converted SNN model with frozen core weights and selectively updateable parameters (normalization and clip parameters).\n\n- Allowing an efficient adaptation mechanism where only these parameters are fine-tuned online guided by the unsupervised entropy loss computed instantaneously over multiple time steps.\n\n- Reducing memory and computational cost by using surrogate gradient methods with partial gradient flow, enabling deployment on edge devices.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\nThe \"Conversion to SNN\" ([mask1]) supports partial parameter fine-tuning alongside unsupervised loss during online adaptation by providing a pretrained source ANN model converted into an SNN model with most core weights frozen and only a small subset of parameters—specifically normalization layer affine parameters and adaptive activation clip parameters—enabled for gradient updates. This selective tuning, guided by an unsupervised entropy loss computed over multiple time steps, enables efficient online adaptation of the SNN model to domain-shifted test data. The scheme leverages surrogate gradients and a computationally efficient online learning algorithm that avoids full BPTT unrolling, thus allowing partial parameter fine-tuning with unsupervised loss in a memory- and computation-efficient manner suitable for on-device deployment."

These layers include spiking and activation layers whose weights and activation scaling parameters are fine-tuned using an approximate backpropagation through time algorithm based on an unsupervised entropy loss calculated at each time step. By adjusting the synaptic weights and activation scales in these layers, the membrane potentials of neurons in the SNN accumulate inputs differently, altering spike timing and firing rates across multiple time steps. This adaptive modulation enables the SNN model ([mask2]) to dynamically adjust its firing patterns in response to domain shifts or corrupted inputs, thereby improving performance while maintaining computational efficiency through partial parameter updates and forward-in-time gradient approximations.\n\n---\n\n# Final concise answer:\n\nThe gradient-enabled layers ([mask1]) adaptively modify synaptic weights and activation scaling within the SNN model ([mask2]), thereby shaping how membrane potentials accumulate and spikes fire over multiple time steps.

**Shift and concentration of firing rate distribution towards lower values**, leading to non-uniform spike firing patterns and degraded quantization of temporal representation, especially at low time steps.\n\n- To solve this, an **adaptive activation scaling scheme** is introduced to dynamically control the firing rate distribution and improve adaptation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Identify the limitations arising from using unsupervised loss in spiking layers as highlighted or implied in the text:\n\n1. **Performance degradation due to non-uniform firing rate distribution**:  \n   - Direct application of unsupervised loss on spiking neurons causes firing rates to shift towards lower values, reducing spike activity and harming information encoding in SNN layers.\n\n2. **Computational complexity and memory cost of full BPTT**:  \n   - While unsupervised adaptation usually involves backpropagation through time (BPTT), this becomes expensive and impractical for online adaptation on edge devices due to large memory and compute requirements.\n\n3. **The necessity for approximate gradient methods**:  \n   - To mitigate the above, approximate forward-in-time optimization algorithms that partially decouple temporal gradients are used, which is a tradeoff between computational efficiency and exact gradient computation.\n\n4. **Model collapse issues**:  \n   - Without carefully designed mechanisms like temperature smoothing and confidence-based weighting (especially for detection), unsupervised entropy minimization can cause the model predictions to collapse to trivial solutions — strongly predicting only a few classes or low-confidence outputs.\n\n5. **Limited adaptation ability if all layers are updated**:  \n   - Only partially updating parameters (e.g., normalization and clipping parameters) is feasible, limiting adaptation capacity if full weight updates were needed.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Summarize key limitations arising specifically from the approach shown in [mask1]:\n\n- **Computational inefficiency of full gradient methods for unsupervised loss in spiking layers** makes direct BPTT infeasible.\n\n- **Direct application of unsupervised loss leads to poor performance without additional mechanisms**, due to the temporal dynamics of spiking neurons — firing rate distributions shift and become non-uniform, degrading model accuracy.\n\n- **Spike-based neuron non-differentiability complicates gradient calculation** requiring surrogate gradient methods and approximate gradient flows.\n\n- **Unsupervised loss minimization risks prediction collapse** without mechanisms such as temperature smoothing or selective instance weighting.\n\n- **Sparse and delayed spike firing patterns in SNNs limit the signal propagation**, thus adaptation can be slower or less effective compared to ANN.\n\n---\n\n# **Final answer:**\n\nThe limitations arising from using unsupervised loss in spiking layers ([mask1]) include:\n\n- **Performance degradation caused by the shift and non-uniformity in the firing rate distribution of spiking neurons during adaptation, which negatively impacts the spiking neural network's ability to encode information effectively.**\n\n- **High computational and memory costs of the standard backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm for training spiking layers over multiple time steps, making it impractical for on-device deployment.**\n\n- **The non-differentiable nature of spike activation functions necessitates surrogate gradient methods, complicating training and potentially reducing adaptation effectiveness.**\n\n- **Without additional mechanisms like adaptive activation scaling, temperature smoothing, and confidence-based instance weighting, unsupervised entropy loss minimization can cause model prediction collapse or degrade performance, especially at low time steps.**\n\n- **Only partial parameter updates are practical, limiting the extent of adaptation achievable by the spiking layers.**\n\nTogether, these limitations require specialized approximations and additional schemes to enable efficient and effective online unsupervised adaptation of SNNs in practical remote sensing scenarios."

From the figure caption and the detailed methodology section, [mask1] corresponds to the part of the pipeline where\n\n- Gradient-enabled layers (some layers are frozen, some are gradient-enabled, as per the legend)\n- Spiking layers and ReLU activation layers are present\n- Fine-tuning (partial parameter updates) occur inside the red box during online adaptation\n- Surrogate gradient through time is used for updating\n- The \"adaptive activation scaling\" scheme is included here to control the firing rate distribution and improve adaptation.\n\nIn other words, [mask1] corresponds to the SNN model layers that undergo **partial parameter fine-tuning with gradients enabled (some frozen layers, some trainable layers)** during online adaptation on test data, using approximated BPTT or its variants.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understanding ANN-SNN conversion in the context\n\nFrom the context:\n\n- The source model is trained as an ANN (e.g., with ReLU activations).\n- The source ANN is converted to an SNN using standard ANN-SNN conversion methods leveraging the mapping between ReLU activations and IF neuron firing rates.\n- The SNN, converted from the ANN, serves as the starting point for online adaptation on corrupted test data via unsupervised entropy loss minimization.\n- The online adaptation uses a surrogate gradient-based backpropagation algorithm, approximating BPTT to reduce complexity (forward-in-time optimization).\n- The \"adaptive activation scaling\" scheme is introduced to address the firing rate distribution issue caused by domain shift.\n- Only partial parameters (normalization affine parameters and scaling parameters) are updated online, i.e., partial fine-tuning within the red box in Fig. 1 (which is [mask1]).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: What constraints does [mask1] (the partially fine-tuned SNN layers in red box) represent?\n\nConstraints here could mean:\n\n- Frozen layers (some layers are kept frozen as per Fig.1 legend) limit the ability to adjust all model parameters.\n- The need to approximate gradients through time incurs computational complexity or memory footprint issues.\n- The partial fine-tuning may limit adaptation performance if the ANN-SNN conversion restricts flexibility.\n- The non-differentiability and surrogate gradients in SNN make optimization less straightforward than ANN adaptations.\n\nThus, the \"constraints\" could summarize:\n\n- Frozen layers restricting learning capacity,\n- Computational overhead in gradient calculation,\n- Difficulty in optimizing due to ANN-SNN conversion,\n- Limited degree of freedom in adaptation (only partial parameters updated).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Could alternative ANN-SNN conversion reduce these constraints?\n\nFrom the text:\n\n- The methodology focuses on ANN-SNN conversion followed by online adaptation. It states explicitly:  \n  > \"The proposed framework is compatible with most deep learning models, such as VGG, ResNet, WideResNet, FCN, and other mainstream models. Moreover, it is applicable to various tasks ...\"\n\n- It also mentions that:  \n  > \"Besides, the proposed method can be straightforwardly applied to **directly trained SNN models**.\"\n\nThis implies that the paper is aware of the option to directly train SNNs rather than relying on ANN-SNN conversion.\n\n- It further states that the proposed adaptation method is designed primarily around converted SNNs from ANN models, but is extendable to directly trained SNNs.\n\n- Importantly, the tight coupling between ANN weights and firing rate normalization is a crucial constraint in typical ANN-SNN conversion and subsequent adaptation.\n\n- Different or improved ANN-SNN conversion methods may allow for better initialization, more trainable parameters, and/or more suitable surrogate gradients, potentially relaxing the partial freezing constraints and improving gradient flow.\n\n- The method uses partial fine-tuning primarily because fully updating all weights online is infeasible or unstable, partly due to the formulation of the ANN-SNN converted model.\n\nHence, if alternative ANN-SNN conversion methods provide a conversion with better matching activation distributions, or better \"trainable\" structures, or even conversion schemes that are more amenable to gradient-based updates (e.g., involving improved surrogate gradient approximations, more flexible firing threshold adaptation, or learnable parameters), then they could potentially reduce the constraints represented by the frozen layers and partial fine-tuning region highlighted in red ([mask1]) and improve online adaptation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Are there textual evidences stating this explicitly?\n\nThe paper says:\n\n- \"The main contributions are summarized as follows.  \n  We propose an online adaptation framework for SNN-based remote sensing.  \n  With a pretrained SNN model from ANN-SNN conversion, we design an efficient, unsupervised online adaptation algorithm.\"  \n- \"Besides, simplified online SNN optimization algorithm is employed…\"  \n- And importantly,  \n  > \"However, the proposed method can be straightforwardly applied to directly trained SNN models.\"  \n\nThis suggests that although the paper works with ANN-SNN conversion based SNNs, other conversion schemes or directly trained SNNs are possible and may influence the constraints on online adaptation.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Summary/Answer:**\n\nYes, alternative ANN-SNN conversion methods — or even directly trained SNN models — could potentially reduce the constraints related to partial parameter fine-tuning and frozen layers in the online adaptation pipeline (i.e., the part highlighted by the red box, [mask1]). Improved ANN-SNN conversion techniques might produce SNN models structured for better gradient flow and adaptability, thereby allowing more layers or parameters to be fine-tuned online and overcoming certain limitations imposed by the conversion. This could enhance the capacity and efficiency of online adaptation and mitigate the constraints encountered in the current pipeline.\n\n---\n\n# **Final Answer:**\n\nYes. Alternative ANN-SNN conversion methods could reduce the constraints in the online adaptation pipeline represented by the red box ([mask1]). By producing SNN models with improved activation distributions or more flexible trainable parameters, such conversion approaches can allow more effective and less constrained online fine-tuning, potentially enabling more layers to be updated rather than frozen, thus enhancing adaptation performance and efficiency. Additionally, directly trained SNN models may also alleviate some of these constraints since they are not limited by the initial ANN mapping."

Initial errors in Stage 1 propagate into Stage 2’s inputs, which can be magnified given that Stage 2 also autoregressively predicts further into the future.\n   - This compounding effect means that errors can accumulate across both time steps and model stages, potentially degrading forecast accuracy especially for longer lead times (up to 12 hours).\n\n5. **Summary:**  \n   The cascading of Stage 1 and Stage 2 autoregressive predictions risks cumulative or compounding errors because errors in the Stage 1 predictions feed directly into Stage 2’s inputs, and the autoregressive setup in both stages can cause errors to accumulate and amplify over time and model stages.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe cumulative error risks resulting from cascading the DaYu Stage 1 and Stage 2 autoregressive predictions stem from error accumulation and propagation across both stages. Since Stage 2 uses Stage 1’s predicted outputs (instead of true observations) as inputs, any errors made in Stage 1 are carried forward and potentially amplified in Stage 2’s predictions. Additionally, the autoregressive nature of predictions within each stage means that errors at each time step accumulate over successive predictions, leading to compounded forecasting errors during long-term cloud image forecasting."

These approaches reduce the number of tokens or feature dimensionality input to the subsequent transformer layers, thereby significantly lowering the memory and computational cost while maintaining the capacity to capture essential features for accurate forecasting."

Instead, dividing forecasting into two stages (0-6 hours and 6-12 hours) allows the model to specialize and reduce cumulative error more effectively.\n\n- **Training and performance benefits:**  \n  Each stage model is trained/fine-tuned in a restricted horizon, making it easier to learn, more stable, and more accurate. Cascading them extends the overall forecast horizon to 12 hours without a huge error jump.\n\n- **Computational and modeling feasibility:**  \n  Handling the entire 12-hour forecast in one model would increase complexity and computational burden. Cascading smaller horizon models is more tractable and leverages autoregression better.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe motivation behind cascading the DaYu stage1 and stage2 autoregressive models, instead of using a single direct forecast model, is to effectively mitigate significant prediction errors that arise when trying to directly predict 12 hours ahead from current observations. By breaking down the forecasting horizon into two stages—first forecasting the 0-6 hour period (stage1), then the 6-12 hour period (stage2)—each sub-model can specialize in a shorter prediction interval, reducing error accumulation and improving overall prediction accuracy. This staged autoregressive approach is also more computationally feasible and allows for more stable training and fine-tuning, ultimately enabling more reliable and precise multi-step cloud image predictions over 12 hours.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n_Cascading stage1 and stage2 autoregressive models is motivated by the difficulty and high error rate of direct long-range forecasting, and by breaking the task into shorter intervals it reduces cumulative errors, stabilizes training, and achieves better prediction performance._"

Residual Convolution Layer (×1) at resolution \\( t \\times c \\times \\frac{H}{4} \\times \\frac{W}{4} \\)\n  - Residual Convolution Layer (×4) at resolution \\( t \\times c \\times \\frac{H}{8} \\times \\frac{W}{8} \\)\n  - Transformer Layer (×14) at resolution \\( t \\times c \\times \\frac{H}{16} \\times \\frac{W}{16} \\)\n- The Decoder mirrors this structure with upsampling and similar layers.\n- The [mask1] area (highlighted in red) is labeled **Skip Connection** linking corresponding Residual Convolution Layers in the Encoder to Residual Convolution Layers in the Decoder, as well as similarly connecting the Transformer layers.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Understand what skip connections typically do\n\n- **Skip connections (or residual connections)** in encoder-decoder architectures are widely known to:\n  - **Preserve spatial details** that may be lost during downsampling in the encoder.\n  - Facilitate **gradient flow** during training, addressing vanishing/exploding gradients.\n  - Allow the decoder to leverage **low-level features** from the encoder with high-level global features, improving reconstruction quality.\n- They also allow **different levels of information to be combined** effectively—for example, combining fine-grained spatial details (from conv layers) with global context (from transformer layers).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Link the role of the [mask1] skip connections to the specific design and needs of DaYu\n\n- From the context:\n  - The data input is very large, \\( 8 \\times 2401 \\times 2401 \\).\n  - The model uses **convolutional patch embedding and residual convolution layers for feature extraction and dimension reduction**, followed by a **stack of transformer layers to capture global relationships**.\n  - The skip connections in [mask1] **connect encoder and decoder layers at the same scale and feature type.**\n  - The **encoder compresses and abstracts the features progressively**, while the decoder attempts to reconstruct the predicted cloud image.\n  \n**Therefore, the purpose of the skip connections is:**\n\n- To **pass spatially-preserved, multi-scale features from the encoder to the decoder**, enabling the decoder to recover **fine-grained spatial information** lost during downsampling steps.\n- To **help combine the localized detailed features (from residual convolution layers) with global context captured by the transformer layers during reconstruction**, promoting better accuracy and image quality.\n- To enhance **feature reuse, improve the training convergence**, and reduce information bottlenecks typical in deep encoder-decoder models.\n- Especially in an autoregressive weather forecast model for complex cloud images, preserving **both local details (for mesoscale and small-scale events) and global spatial relationships** is critical.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Chain-of-thought answer to the question\n\n**Why implement [mask1] linking Residual Convolution Layers and Transformer Layer features?**\n\n- DaYu integrates convolutional and transformer layers because:\n  - Convolutional layers are effective at extracting local, spatial features at varying resolutions.\n  - Transformer layers excel at modeling global dependencies and contextual information.\n- During encoding, representations are compressed, potentially losing spatial details critical for accurate image reconstruction.\n- The skip connections ([mask1]) enable the decoder to receive **direct access to corresponding encoded features at matching resolutions**, bypassing the bottleneck.\n- This allows the decoder to combine global, abstract features from the transformer layers with preserved spatial and multi-scale convolutional features.\n- Consequently, it facilitates **better reconstruction of the next-step predicted cloud images with improved spatial fidelity and temporal coherence**.\n- Moreover, these skip connections enhance gradient flow and stabilize training, important considering the model depth and complexity.\n- This design ultimately improves the model's forecasting accuracy by preserving critical spatial structures associated with meteorological phenomena.\n\n---\n\n### Final concise answer\n\nThe skip connections ([mask1]) linking the Residual Convolution Layers and Transformer Layer features between the encoder and decoder are implemented to preserve and transmit multi-scale spatial details and global contextual information from the encoding stages directly to the corresponding decoding stages. This facilitates better reconstruction of cloud images by combining fine-grained local features with high-level global features, improves gradient flow during training, and helps the model capture both local mesoscale and global atmospheric patterns, thereby enhancing forecasting accuracy and fidelity."

This dual objective enables the slide aggregator to learn multimodal representations that are both coherent across modalities and discriminative with respect to cancer types, thereby improving the robustness and biological relevance of the learned model.\n\n# Final Answer:\n\nThe combination of the inter-modality contrastive learning ([mask1]) and inter-cancer contrastive learning ([mask2]) objectives is motivated by the need to inject multimodal knowledge at the whole-slide level while simultaneously addressing the heterogeneity of various cancer types. Inter-modality contrastive learning aligns representations from different modalities of the same patient to capture complementary multimodal features, whereas inter-cancer contrastive learning leverages inherent cancer labels to bring together samples from the same cancer type and separate different cancer types, thus mitigating heterogeneity. Together, these objectives enable the slide aggregator to learn robust, multimodal, and cancer-aware representations that effectively integrate multimodal information and account for cancer-specific variations."

The context describes the Med-PMC evaluation framework, which includes a patient-actor agent designed to simulate realistic patient behaviors and responses in clinical scenarios.\n\n2. The patient-actor agent consists of three main components, which correspond exactly to the modules depicted in the red box (\"Patient Simulator\"): \n   - State Tracker\n   - Response Generator (referred here as Final Response in the diagram)\n   - Personalized Actor\n\n3. The State Tracker categorizes doctor actions into specific types such as Specific or Broad, Basic Information Inquiry or Medical Examination Recommendations, and Relevant or Irrelevant. This classification guides how the patient simulator will respond and interact.\n\n4. The Response Generator produces replies based on the classified doctor actions. It handles scenarios like vague questions by asking for specificity, provides relevant information if available, or replies \"I don't know\" to irrelevant or unavailable information.\n\n5. The Personalized Actor rewrites or modulates the generated responses by applying personalized patient characteristics such as tone and personality, modeled by various patient personas (different genders and professions). This simulates diversity in patient expression and behavior.\n\n6. By having these three components, the Patient Simulator merges state tracking (tracking the doctor’s inquiry types and relevance) with personalized personas (modeling different patient behaviors and expressions). This design aligns with existing role-playing simulation methods by enabling both an understanding of the interaction context (via state tracking) and realistic, varied patient responses (via personalized acting).\n\nTherefore, the Patient Simulator merges state tracking and personalized personas by first categorizing and tracking the doctor’s actions using a state tracker, then generating context-sensitive responses accordingly, and finally rewriting these responses through personalized patient personas to simulate diverse and realistic patient behaviors—thus combining structured state understanding with role-played personality expression in the simulated clinical environment."

        "response": "The [mask1] in the question refers to the \"LLM-based Evaluation,\" which is highlighted in the red box in part (c) Evaluation of the Med-PMC framework diagram.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning to answer the question:\n\n1. The Med-PMC evaluation framework aims to simulate a clinical environment to assess multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) in realistic clinical scenarios. It comprises multi-modal consultation, patient simulation, and evaluation.\n\n2. The \"automatic evaluation\" uses objective metrics such as ROUGE-1 to measure information gathering and decision-making performance by comparing model outputs against ground truth data. This is an established quantitative approach.\n\n3. The \"LLM-based Evaluation\" complements the automatic evaluation by leveraging LLMs themselves as evaluators based on specialized prompts assessing multiple clinical dimensions: inquiry, examination, multi-modal analysis, diagnosis, and treatment.\n\n4. The LLM-based evaluation uses prompts inspired by clinical assessment standards from authoritative healthcare institutions, scoring outputs on a scale of 1-5, thus mimicking human expert judgments and capturing qualitative nuances of clinical reasoning and consultation ability.\n\n5. By integrating LLM-based evaluation with automatic metrics, the framework benefits from a dual evaluation approach: quantitative consistency and qualitative interpretability, thereby enabling a more comprehensive and reliable assessment of MLLM clinical capabilities.\n\n6. This approach addresses limitations of prior frameworks that rely solely on static or automatic metrics and/or lack multi-turn and multi-modal interaction, as well as a human-like evaluation perspective.\n\nIn summary, the LLM-based evaluation complements automatic evaluation by providing an interpretable, expert-like assessment that captures clinical consultation quality across multiple dimensions, thereby enhancing the comprehensiveness and reliability of Med-PMC’s evaluation of MLLMs in simulated clinical settings.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe LLM-based evaluation complements automatic evaluation by providing a qualitatively rich, multi-dimensional assessment of MLLMs' clinical consultation performance using expert-inspired prompts and scoring. This approach simulates human expert judgment on inquiry, examination, multi-modal analysis, diagnosis, and treatment, thereby enhancing the evaluation framework beyond purely quantitative metrics. By combining both methods, Med-PMC achieves a more comprehensive and reliable assessment of MLLM performance in dynamic, multi-modal, multi-turn clinical interactions, overcoming limitations of prior multimodal clinical assessment frameworks that relied predominantly on static or automatic evaluations."

Knowledge-Based QA\n\nWithin **Dialogue Transcription** (left panel), the flow for multi-turn dialogue generation involves three steps:\n- Generate → Evidence → Optimize\n\n\"Evidence\" is the intermediate step boxed in red.\n\nThe text referring to **III-B Multi-Turn Dialogue Construction** elaborates these steps in detail:\n\n1. **Generation step:**  \n   KimiChat generates the multi-turn dialogue from top-upvoted single-turn QA pairs.\n\n2. **Evidence judgment step (highlighted step):**  \n   Uses an additional prompt to assess whether the multi-turn dialogue answers are supported by the original context.  \n   \n   Specifically, if most answers in the dialogue are supported by evidence extracted from the original text, it better reflects realistic counselor conversations.  \n   \n   If answers are generated mainly by the model without grounding in the original context, those dialogues require further processing by prompting the integration of factual evidence from the original data.\n\n3. **Optimization step:**  \n   Further revises the dialogue for empathy, supportiveness, guidance, and safety, then manual proofreading.\n\nThus, **the \"Evidence\" judgment step acts as a quality control to check grounding/factual support from the original data before optimization.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Reasoning - How Evidence judgment enhances fidelity\n\n- **Fidelity** here means how truthful, accurate, and contextually grounded the generated dialogues are relative to the source data.\n\n- By verifying if the generated responses in the dialogue can be supported by evidence extracted from the original text:\n\n  - Non-factual or hallucinated responses (responses not supported by context) can be identified.\n\n  - These low-fidelity outputs can then be enhanced by incorporating factually relevant content in a subsequent prompt.\n\n- This process ensures that dialogue generation remains faithful to the original knowledge and does not deviate arbitrarily, thus improving quality before the final optimization stage.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\nThe **\"Evidence\" judgment step** enhances fidelity in multi-turn dialogue generation by assessing whether the generated responses are supported by factual evidence from the original context. This grounding check ensures that the dialogue content aligns with real-world psychological information rather than being predominantly model-generated without factual basis. When responses lack sufficient evidence, they are further processed using targeted prompts to integrate relevant factual information. This verification and adjustment step effectively ensures that the multi-turn dialogues maintain high contextual accuracy and realism before undergoing the final optimization step.\n\n---\n\n# **Answer:**\n\nThe \"Evidence\" judgment step enhances fidelity before the optimization step in multi-turn dialogue generation by verifying that the generated responses are supported by factual evidence extracted from the original context. This ensures that the dialogues accurately reflect real-world conversational content rather than relying mainly on model-generated text without grounding. If most responses lack sufficient evidence, the step prompts further integration of relevant factual information from the original data, thereby improving the accuracy and realism of the dialogue before optimization."

The red box portion focuses primarily on:\n   - Encoding features.\n   - Computing and optimizing similarity matrices based on fixed mini-batch samples.\n   - Minimizing intra-modal feature drift and inter-modal distance.\n\n2. According to the context, **the limitation of prior methods (not necessarily II Loss itself, but fixed-duration sampling or simple inter-modal loss)** was neglecting diverse matches.\n\n3. The figure and description show the red box is a *loss construction*, not a feature sampler or multimodal information integrator.\n\n4. Because it works on batch samples with one-to-one pairs, and the loss pushes away all negatives, it may not fully capture cases where one music suits many videos or vice versa unless properly accounted for by the intra-modal loss.\n\n5. More specifically, the red box design treats the input video and music feature sequences independently and relies on similarity matrices to guide the optimization. The approach **may not fully model complex, diverse semantic relationships** beyond similarity constraints.\n\n6. Additionally, the red box components process video and music as *pre-extracted feature sequences*, lacking explicit mechanisms to capture broader semantic context or cross-modal relational dynamics that could better capture diversity.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis:\nThe **limitations of the red box's Inter-Intra Modal Loss module** (i.e., [mask1]) for capturing diverse video-music content relationships are:\n\n- It is constrained by the reliance on **pre-extracted features and similarity-based losses**, which may not fully model the broad and complex **one-to-many or many-to-many** relationships inherently present in video-music pairing scenarios.\n- The inter-modal loss, even combined with intra-modal loss, may **still have challenges in distinguishing diverse but relevant positive matches**, since it optimizes based on batch similarity and negative sampling strategies.\n- The loss operates on encoded feature distributions, which might not capture subtle or high-level semantic relationships or dynamic cross-modal interactions beyond similarity measures.\n- The model could underrepresent the diversity in content relationships if only one-to-one pairings dominate in training data batches.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion - final answer:\n\n**The limitations of the Inter-Intra Modal Loss module ([mask1]) in capturing diverse video-music content relationships lie in its reliance on feature similarity measures and batch-wise paired training. While it mitigates false negative noise by preserving intra-modal feature distributions, it may still inadequately model complex one-to-many or many-to-many matching relationships and subtle semantic diversities between videos and music. This is because it depends mainly on similarity matrices computed from pre-extracted features and does not explicitly model broader semantic context or diverse cross-modal relationships.**\n\n---\n\nIf more details were needed, we could consult references, but based on the provided context and diagram, this captures the key limitation of [mask1]."

Their parameters are frozen when fine-tuning. Examples include Inception-v3, ViT, CLIP-Vision for video; VGGish, PANNs for audio.\n\n- Their **quality and biases** impact the features extracted from videos and music that form the basis of all further encoding and retrieval steps.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: How pretrained feature bias could affect retrieval fairness across diverse video-music samples?\n\n- The **pretrained feature extractors are based on datasets that might be biased** — for example, over-representing some styles, genres, cultures, or content types, while under-representing others.\n\n- These biases affect the **discriminative ability and representational fairness** of video and music feature embeddings.\n\n- As a consequence, some video-music pairs representing **underrepresented or minority classes/styles** may have poorer feature representations, leading to worse retrieval **matching scores**.\n\n- Because the retrieval is heavily dependent on the **feature distance in the encoded space**, biased pretrained features **amplify disparities** in retrieval performance by favoring better-represented content and **disfavoring rarer or diverse samples.**\n\n- Hence, retrieval fairness degrades — some types of video-music pairs are favored, while others are unfairly penalized.\n\n- Moreover, **false negative noise** in training (videos and musics that are suitable but not paired) exacerbates the problem, as the model may overfit to biases in the pretrained features during contrastive training.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: How does II Loss mitigate or relate to this?\n\n- II Loss aims to **preserve feature distribution consistency** within each modality (video, music) through the intra-modal loss, preventing drastic variation and overfitting to noise.\n\n- By maintaining the pretrained feature space structure and reducing overfitting, the II Loss **helps reduce the bias amplification** caused by pretrained feature extractors.\n\n- However, if pretrained features are biased to begin with, there is inherent limitation: **the quality and fairness of pretrained embeddings are foundational.**\n\n- Therefore, **biased pretrained feature extractors may limit fairness and generalization across diverse data**, even if II Loss helps mitigate some negative impact.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary Answer:\n\n**Biased pretrained feature extractors (highlighted in the red [mask1] area) can adversely affect retrieval fairness across diverse video-music samples by producing skewed or less representative embeddings for underrepresented or minority content types. Because retrieval depends on feature distances, such bias may cause the retrieval system to favor frequently represented video-music styles while penalizing others, leading to unfair and less generalized results. Although the proposed inter-intra modal loss (II Loss) partially mitigates this by preserving intra-modal feature distributions and reducing overfitting to noise, the inherent biases in pretrained features still impose limitations on retrieval fairness and effectiveness across diverse samples.**\n\n---\n\n# **Direct concise answer:**\n\nBiased pretrained feature extractors inside the red-boxed area ([mask1]) generate unequal, skewed feature representations for diverse video and music samples, favoring well-represented content and disadvantaging underrepresented types. This bias reduces retrieval fairness by causing the model to perform better for certain styles or genres while neglecting others. Although the inter-intra modal loss helps maintain feature distribution consistency and mitigates overfitting to noise, it cannot fully compensate for the intrinsic bias in the pretrained features that ultimately limits fair and balanced retrieval performance across diverse video-music pairs."

        "response": "Let's analyze the question and context step-by-step:\n\n**Question:**  \nWhat are the limitations of [mask1] with high-resolution image features?\n\n**[mask1] in the diagram:**  \nThe red box highlights the \"Multi-modal Parallel Graph Autoencoder\" (MPGA) component of the stMMC model. This module consists of two independent graph autoencoders (GAEs), one for gene expression modality and one for image feature modality, followed by feature aggregation, and then a graph decoder reconstructs the gene expression data. This module integrates gene expression data and histology image features.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the role of the Multi-modal Parallel Graph Autoencoder (MPGA)\n\n- The MPGA takes as input two modalities: gene expression data and learned histology image patch features.\n- It uses two GAEs to learn embeddings from each modality independently.\n- These embeddings are aggregated by a learnable weight and then passed to a graph decoder.\n- The graph decoder reconstructs the gene expression data.\n- The MPGA structure is illustrated and explained in section III-B, equations (1)-(4).\n\n### Step 2: Understand what \"high-resolution image features\" mean in this context\n\n- The paper uses two datasets with different histology image resolutions:\n  - DLPFC dataset: image patches about 96 pixels wide.\n  - mouse_3x3_1mm dataset: image patches about 219 pixels wide (higher resolution).\n- Both datasets show improved clustering when histology image features are incorporated.\n- Higher resolution images should give more detailed image features.\n\n### Step 3: From the context, what limitations of MPGA with high-resolution image features are mentioned or implied?\n\n- In **IV-C Results on Model Annotated Data**, the higher resolution histology image in mouse_3x3_1mm helps stMMC to achieve better performance.\n- This suggests the model can utilize high-res images advantageously.\n\n- However, the question asks about limitations of MPGA with high-resolution image features.\n\n- The **related works** section mentions that current analytical methods do not fully integrate spatial information and histology image with gene expression data, limiting the ability to extract critical info like cell-cell interactions.\n\n- The **introduction and methods** describe that the image features are extracted by pre-trained autoencoders based on ImageNet, which may not be trained specifically for histology data, which could limit the expressiveness of the image features.\n\n- There is no explicit statement about the MPGA limitations with high-resolution images. But based on typical challenges in multimodal fusion via graph autoencoders:\n\n  - High-resolution images produce large and/or more complex feature vectors which may cause increased computational demands and require more complex model architectures.\n  \n  - The MPGA uses independent GAEs per modality before aggregation, which might limit the deep fusion of modalities, especially if one modality’s data (image features) is of much higher dimension or has more complex structure.\n  \n  - Constructing graphs using the other modality’s proximity may sometimes be sub-optimal when image features become very detailed, possibly causing noise or misrepresentations.\n  \n- The ablation study (section IV-D) shows that omitting histology image features decreases performance, but it is a smaller drop compared to omitting contrastive learning or smoothing. This could indicate that merely including image features is helpful but not the main contributor to performance, possibly pointing to limitations in how image features are utilized.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesizing the answer\n\n- The [mask1] (MPGA) incorporates high-resolution image features through one modality’s GAE.\n\n- The potential limitations with high-resolution image features in MPGA include:\n\n  1. **Insufficient integration or fusion depth:** MPGA treats each modality independently before aggregation, which could limit the ability to fully leverage the rich information in high-resolution images.\n\n  2. **Complexity and computational cost:** High-resolution image features are more complex and higher-dimensional, potentially increasing training and inference time or requiring dimensionality reduction (as done via PCA) which might lose information.\n\n  3. **Potential noise or mismatch in graph construction:** Since graphs for each modality are constructed based on the other modality's proximity or similarity, errors or noise in either modality’s graph affect the other, especially when high-resolution image features might add complexity.\n\n  4. **Dependence on pre-trained image features:** Image features extracted from autoencoders pre-trained on ImageNet might not be fully optimal for histology images, limiting the effectiveness of high-res image data.\n\n  \nThe context, however, does not explicitly state these limitations; they are reasonable inferences based on the descriptions and experiments.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\nThe main limitation of the Multi-modal Parallel Graph Autoencoder (MPGA) with high-resolution image features lies in its independent processing of each modality before aggregation, which may restrict the depth of integration and prevent fully leveraging the rich information contained in high-resolution histology images. Additionally, the increased complexity and dimensionality of high-resolution image features can impose higher computational costs and potential challenges in graph construction, possibly leading to noise or less effective fusion of modalities. Finally, reliance on image features extracted by pre-trained models not specifically tuned for histology may limit the usefulness of high-resolution image data within the MPGA framework."

This is from the input spatial transcriptomics data, where histology images are used to extract image features (via an autoencoder pretrained on ImageNet, as per the context in III-A).\n\n- The **blue box** highlights the **\"Contrastive Learning Mechanism for Gene\"** module. It involves a corrupted gene expression graph \\( G_G^* \\), feeding into a graph convolutional network (GCN), producing learned embeddings \\( \\mathbf{z}_G^* \\), and then producing community representations for the gene modality.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Understand the function of these components and how they relate to clustering.\n\n- **Image Features (red box [mask1])**: \n  - These features are learned representations extracted from the histology images.\n  - They are one modality of data in the multi-modal parallel graph autoencoder (MPGA), used alongside gene expression data.\n  - Incorporating image features adds morphological/spatial information to the clustering that gene expression data alone doesn't fully capture.\n\n- **Contrastive Learning for Gene (blue box [mask2])**:\n  - This mechanism is applied to the gene expression modality to improve the learned gene embeddings.\n  - It uses a corrupted graph to generate negative pairs, pushing the model to learn discriminative, robust node embeddings.\n  - It helps learn feature embeddings that better capture the true local community structure in gene expression data.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Linking the question components\n\nThe question asks:\n- What happens if we *rely on image features (red box)* *within* the *contrastive learning mechanism for gene expression (blue box)*?\n\nHowever, from the diagram and method description, the contrastive learning modules for image and gene modalities are **independent**:\n- The contrastive learning for gene uses **corrupted gene graphs**.\n- The contrastive learning for image uses **corrupted image graphs**.\n  \nThey do not directly incorporate image features into the gene contrastive learning mechanism.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Hypothetical scenario analysis: what if the gene contrastive learning mechanism relied on image features?\n\n- Image features come from histology patches representing tissue morphology.\n- According to the context, *histology features and gene expression are linked but have distinct info.*\n- **Over-reliance on image features within the gene contrastive learning could bias the learned gene embeddings to reflect morphology-driven similarity rather than pure transcriptomic similarity.**\n\n- Consequences:\n  - **Clustering assignments could become biased toward visually similar tissue regions rather than transcriptionally similar cell states.**\n  - Such bias could be problematic where:\n    - Morphologically similar but transcriptionally distinct regions exist.\n    - The histology has artifacts or noise that mislead feature extraction.\n  - Ultimately, it could distort spatial clustering, leading to faults in representing true biological variability.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Support from the context\n\n- The introduction states that current methods often fail to fully integrate histology image features, limiting clustering performance.\n- The model proposed (stMMC) learns gene and image features separately and fuses them thoughtfully, avoiding conflating the two.\n- The ablation study shows removing image features slightly reduces performance—highlighting image features add complementary information but should not dominate or bias gene embeddings.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n**Reliance on histology \"Image Features\" ([mask1]) within the \"Contrastive Learning Mechanism for Gene\" ([mask2]) could bias clustering assignments by causing gene expression embeddings to reflect tissue morphology rather than purely transcriptomic information. This may lead to clustering driven predominantly by visual similarity, potentially grouping transcriptionally distinct spots together or failing to capture genuine gene expression-driven heterogeneity, thus reducing biological interpretability and clustering accuracy.**\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer:\n\nReliance on **Image Features** (red box) within the **Contrastive Learning Mechanism for Gene** (blue box) may bias clustering assignments by causing the gene expression embeddings to be influenced more by tissue morphology patterns than by true transcriptional similarity. This can lead to clusters that reflect morphological similarities rather than genuine differences in gene expression, potentially misleading the spatial clustering results and obscuring meaningful biological distinctions."

According to the caption and diagram, these are **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) layers** for gene expression (`G`) and image features (`I`).\n\n- The **blue box** encompasses the larger block titled **Multi-modal Parallel Graph Autoencoder (MPGA)**.

This allows the system to apply contrastive learning by contrasting true learned embeddings from the original graph (positive pairs) against embeddings learned from corrupted graphs (negative pairs). By doing this separately for each modality, the model forces each graph autoencoder to learn robust, discriminative, and modality-specific representations that better capture the underlying spatial and feature relationships of the data.**"

The motivation for mapping the purity gap through the tanh function to derive the re-initialization strength α is described as follows based on the provided context:\n\n1. The purity gap ΔP is defined as the difference between the clustering purity on the training set (P_D) and the validation set (P_V), which reflects the discrepancy in representation quality or separability between train and validation data for a specific modality's encoder.\n\n2. A large purity gap indicates a well-learnt or even over-trained modality, meaning the encoder might have specialized too much on training data and lost generalization capability on validation data.\n\n3. To balance training across modalities and avoid over-reliance on certain modalities, the authors propose re-initializing the encoder parameters in a soft manner, controlled by a re-initialization strength α, which is a function of the purity gap ΔP.\n\n4. This function α = tanh(k * ΔP) (where k is a hyper-parameter) is chosen because:\n   - The tanh function maps input values to a bounded range between -1 and 1.\n   - Given purity gap ΔP ≥ 0, tanh maps it to between 0 and 1.\n   - It is monotonically increasing for positive inputs, maintaining proportionality with purity gap ΔP.\n   - The bounded and smooth nature of tanh ensures a controlled re-initialization strength that scales gently with the purity gap without drastic changes.\n   \n5. Therefore, using tanh ensures that the re-initialization strength α is always between 0 and 1, and smoothly increases with increasing purity gap, making the strength proportional to the diagnosed learning state discrepancy, allowing an appropriate level of encoder re-initialization based on the modality's state.\n\nIn summary, the tanh function is used to map the purity gap to re-initialization strength because it provides a bounded, smoothly increasing mapping from the purity gap to a meaningful [0,1] range strength value, ensuring α is proportional to the purity gap while preventing excessive or negative re-initializations."

The tanh function has properties such that the output α is bounded between 0 and 1, and is monotonically increasing with respect to the input ΔP (when ΔP ≥ 0).\n5. This ensures that α is proportional to the purity gap: a larger purity gap leads to a higher re-initialization strength α, effectively enabling stronger re-initialization for well-learnt modalities.\n6. Thus, the tanh transformation maps the purity gap ΔP into a bounded and smoothly varying re-initialization strength α.\n\nIn summary, the tanh function serves as the transformation that takes the purity gap as input and outputs a re-initialization strength α in the range [0,1], with a monotonic relationship."

        "response": "To answer the question:  \n**\"How does stop-gradient on [mask1] representations affect recommendation loss optimization?\"**  \nwhere [mask1] refers to the **\"Cache Store\"** component highlighted in the red box in the figure.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand what the Cache Store represents in context\n\nFrom the diagram and the context:\n\n- The **Multi-Modal LLM** (large language model) processes various input tokens: Visual, Textual, Audio.  \n- Its outputs are multi-modal item representations (purple, orange, green vectors) which then feed into a **Cache Store**.  \n- The Cache Store stores these combined multi-modal representations to provide semantic knowledge to the downstream **Recommendation Model**.  \n- The Recommendation Model also takes **ID-based embeddings** as input for learning user-item interactions.\n\nKey statements in the context (Section 2.4 Usage of QARM and Figure 1 description):  \n\n- Multi-modal representations are **pretrained and fine-tuned** via item alignment mechanisms.  \n- These multi-modal representations are cached for downstream usage.  \n- The Cache Store serves the pre-computed multi-modal representations without frequent re-computation.  \n- In downstream recommendation model training, the ID-based embeddings are learnable and trained end-to-end.  \n- However, multi-modal representations traditionally are **non-end-to-end (frozen)** and only serve as static input features, which leads to the \"Representation Unlearning\" problem.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Role of Stop-Gradient in Figure 1 and Context\n\nIn the figure (right side), there is a label \"stop-gradient\" on the arrows connecting the Cache Store to the Recommendation Model. This means that:\n\n- When the recommendation loss is back-propagated, gradients **do NOT flow back through the Cache Store** or through the Multi-Modal LLM representation that has been stored in the Cache Store.  \n- The multi-modal representations fetched from the Cache Store are treated as **fixed (non-learnable, frozen) inputs** during recommendation model training.  \n- Only the ID-based embeddings and other recommendation model parameters get updated via backpropagation.\n\nFrom the text in 1. Introduction and 2.2/2.3 (Representation Unlearning):\n\n- \"In practice, newly added multi-modal features do NOT update with the training of the recommendation system.\"  \n- \"Such static multi-modal representations limit model fitting ability and obstruct convergence.\"  \n- Use of \"stop-gradient\" enforces the representations to be frozen during recommendation model training.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Effect of Stop-Gradient on Optimization of Recommendation Loss\n\nBecause of stop-gradient on the Cache Store’s multi-modal representations:\n\n- The multi-modal representations are **frozen**; they do not adapt or update in response to the recommendation loss.  \n- The recommendation loss is optimized **only through the other learnable components**, typically the ID-based embeddings and the recommendation model parameters themselves.  \n- The multi-modal representations provide **static semantic signals**, but do NOT get tuned for downstream recommendation objectives.  \n- This results in **limited ability of the recommendation model to fully leverage multi-modal signals**, as the multi-modal features do not improve or change based on user interaction data.  \n- There is a **representation unlearning problem** leading to possibly slower convergence or suboptimal model fitting.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Summary of the effect\n\n- **Stop-gradient prevents backpropagation of the recommendation loss into the multi-modal representations stored in the Cache Store.**  \n- This keeps the multi-modal features fixed/frozen.  \n- It restricts end-to-end learning of multi-modal semantic representations tailored to the downstream recommendation task, potentially limiting model performance gains.  \n- The recommendation model can still learn and optimize with respect to its own parameters and ID embeddings, but cannot improve the multi-modal features.  \n\n---\n\n## **Final Answer**:\n\nThe stop-gradient operation on the Cache Store's multi-modal representations prevents gradients from flowing back during recommendation loss optimization. As a result, the multi-modal representations remain fixed and are not updated or fine-tuned in an end-to-end manner with the recommendation model training. This frozen setup limits the recommendation model’s ability to adapt and optimize these multi-modal features according to real-time user-item interactions, potentially causing suboptimal convergence and restricting performance improvements from multi-modal information."

This module is frozen during training/fine-tuning in the proposed pipeline.\n\nThe extracted features from this UNet feed into the Mask Generator ([mask2]) to guide the segmentation.\n\nThe diffusion model is **conditioned** on text embeddings (coming from an implicit captioner) through cross-attention, but the core feature extractor (UNet) remains frozen.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Role of [mask2] (Mask Generator)\n\nThe **Mask Generator** (Mask2Former architecture) takes the extracted features from [mask1] and produces:\n\n- Class-agnostic binary masks (individual segmentations of lesions or objects).\n- Mask embeddings, representing objects detected.\n\nIt is the trainable component that outputs the segmentation mask predictions, and its outputs are supervised using mask loss and classification loss (via dot product with category embeddings).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Effect of Freezing [mask1] on [mask2] Adaptation\n\n- Freezing [mask1] (the diffusion UNet) means that its weights **do not update during fine-tuning**.\n- This implies that the feature extraction part is **fixed**: the learned feature representations stay constant.\n- Because the features passed to the Mask Generator are fixed, the **Mask Generator must adapt to learn how to map these fixed features to accurate masks**.\n\nHence:\n\n- During fine-tuning, adaptation happens primarily in the downstream modules: the MLP projecting image embeddings to text embeddings (implicit captioner), the Mask Generator ([mask2]), and possibly the classification head.\n- Since [mask1] is frozen, the Mask Generator's ability to adapt depends on how well it can learn to produce masks from **fixed, frozen** features.\n- The frozen UNet may impose a limitation on adaptation flexibility but ensures stable, robust features trained on large datasets (e.g., MAM-E trained on mammograms), providing good input for mask prediction.\n- The Mask Generator does have to **learn to interpret these frozen features**, which may be challenging given domain shifts or the complexity of lesion appearances.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n**Freezing the Text-to-Image Diffusion UNet ([mask1]) fixes the feature extractor, which means the Mask Generator ([mask2]) has to adapt entirely to the fixed feature representations during fine-tuning. This limits the feature-level adaptability but allows the Mask Generator to learn segmentation mappings based on stable, high-quality extracted features.**\n\n---\n\n# Final Answer:\n\nFreezing the Text-to-Image Diffusion UNet ([mask1]) causes the features it extracts to remain fixed during fine-tuning, preventing adaptation in the feature extraction stage. Consequently, the Mask Generator ([mask2]) must adapt to these fixed features to learn how to generate accurate masks. This means that during fine-tuning, the Mask Generator bears full responsibility for interpreting the frozen features and producing correct segmentation predictions, limiting overall adaptation flexibility but potentially benefiting from stable, domain-specific feature representations provided by the frozen UNet."

Freezing it means it cannot adapt to other subtleties or variations in data, such as pathological cases or diverse populations.  \n   - This may result in **systematic bias** if the frozen model does not adequately represent underrepresented groups or rare conditions, potentially leading to misdiagnosis or reduced accuracy for certain patients.\n\n2. **Reduced Model Responsiveness to New Data or Annotations:**  \n   - Freezing prevents the model from learning new or corrective patterns from annotated malignant or benign lesions during downstream training, which could limit performance or perpetuate existing errors.  \n   - This could imply ethical issues regarding **accuracy, fairness, and patient safety**, since the model may not improve with new clinical evidence.\n\n3. **Reliance on a Fixed Black-Box Model:**  \n   - Using a frozen feature extractor might hinder transparency and explainability since the model’s internal representations do not evolve with training.  \n   - This may limit clinicians’ or regulators' trust in AI outputs, raising concerns about the **accountability of AI-assisted diagnosis**.\n\n4. **Potential for Overconfidence in Unadapted Features:**  \n   - If the frozen module embeds features inadequately tailored to malignancies or specific lesion types, the downstream segmentation and classification may be unreliable.  \n   - This unreliability might cause harm through false positives or false negatives, which is a significant ethical issue in disease diagnosis.\n\n**Step 4: Summarize and articulate ethical concerns:**\n\n- **Bias and lack of adaptability:** Freezing limits model adaptability to diverse, possibly underrepresented patient data, risking biased diagnostic performance.  \n- **Compromised accuracy and patient safety:** The frozen model may perpetuate errors or fail to learn from pathology-specific data, potentially jeopardizing diagnostic accuracy.  \n- **Transparency and accountability limitations:** Fixed models offer less insight, possibly reducing trust and responsible deployment in clinical settings.  \n- **Risk of harm through inaccurate predictions:** Faulty segmentation due to unadapted features may lead to misdiagnosis, impacting patient treatment decisions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nFreezing the Text-to-Image Diffusion UNet (the module highlighted by [mask1]) during training on mammography images raises several ethical concerns. It limits the model's ability to adapt and learn from diverse or pathological cases, potentially embedding biases that affect underrepresented patient groups and compromising diagnostic accuracy. This rigidity may perpetuate errors or overlook subtle lesion features, risking patient safety through false positive or negative diagnoses. Additionally, relying on a frozen, unmodifiable model reduces transparency and accountability, which are critical for clinical trust and ethical deployment of AI tools in medical diagnosis."

The red box zooms into the internal structure of a Swin Transformer Block showing components like:\n- MLP (Multi-layer Perceptron)\n- LN (Layer Normalization)\n- W-MSA (Window-based Multi-head Self-Attention)\n\n**From the context:**\n\n1. **Role of Swin Transformer in the model:**\n   - The diffusion transformer segmentation (DTS) model replaces CNN encoders with the Swin Transformer encoder for scalability and computational efficiency.\n   - The Swin Transformer encoder captures hierarchical features of medical images with window-based self-attention (W-MSA).\n   - This window-based self-attention breaks down the image into windows (local patches) and computes self-attention within those windows.\n\n2. **Potential limitations highlighted in the text:**\n   - The introduction and related work emphasize that medical images, especially CT scans, often have **high noise levels and ambiguous organ boundaries**.\n   - Despite advantages of Swin Transformer architecture, the text hints at challenges when dealing with high-frequency noise and subtle details.\n   - It specifically mentions existing diffusion models perform poorly in small organs/organs with ambiguous boundaries, implying that local self-attention in windows might miss global context or be less robust to noise within local windows.\n   - The text also states they **break away from conventional Denoising U-Net architectures** to handle diverse medical imaging data better.\n\n3. **Interpretation of limitations due to W-MSA in Swin Transformer under noisy medical images:**\n   - Window-based self-attention computes attention only within fixed local windows. In **high-noise scenarios**, these local windows can contain heavy noise that overwhelms the signal.\n   - Because attention is limited to windows, it **may miss global context and dependencies** that help disambiguate noisy pixels.\n   - This can harm the feature representation, causing difficulty in capturing **fine anatomical details or subtle organ boundaries** in noisy images.\n   - Thus, W-MSA's **local scope and sensitivity to noise** may limit performance in high-noise medical images.\n\n4. **Supporting info from context:**\n   - The authors incorporate **morphology-driven learning techniques** (like reverse boundary attention and label smoothing) to compensate for these limitations by capturing global structure and boundary details beyond local window attention.\n   - They highlight that diffusion segmentation models with CNN inductive biases handle noise better traditionally, but Swin Transformer can replace CNN only with added enhancements.\n\n**In summary:**  \nThe limitations arising from the Swin Transformer block’s window-based self-attention under high-noise medical images are primarily due to its local window scope, which makes it vulnerable to noise concentrated in local patches and limits its ability to capture long-range dependencies and global context necessary for disambiguating noisy features and preserving fine structural details.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe Swin Transformer block’s window-based self-attention is limited under high-noise medical images because its local windowed attention mechanism restricts context to small patches, making it sensitive to heavy noise within these windows. This local scope reduces its ability to capture global contextual information and long-range dependencies, which are crucial for accurately representing subtle anatomical details and ambiguous organ boundaries in noisy medical images. Consequently, the window-based self-attention can struggle to effectively handle noise, leading to decreased segmentation performance in these challenging scenarios."

        "response": "To answer the question about how the [mask1]’s downsampling could compromise fine-detail retention in [mask2] hierarchies, we need to carefully analyze both the diagram and the extensive context describing the architecture and methodology of the proposed diffusion transformer segmentation (DTS) model.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify [mask1] and [mask2] in the diagram and their roles\n\n- **[mask1] (Red box): Patch Merging**\n  - According to the diagram and the inset at the top-right, the red-highlighted **Patch Merging** sits right after the SW (Shifted Window) Block in the Swin Transformer block.\n  - The process of patch merging represents **downsampling** within the Swin Transformer encoder.\n  - Patch Merging reduces spatial resolution by combining neighboring patches, effectively reducing feature map size.\n\n- **[mask2] (Blue box): Diffusion Encoder**\n  - The blue box surrounds a sequence of vertically stacked blocks (green-tinted), representing the **Diffusion Encoder**, which uses the hierarchical structure of the Swin Transformer.\n  - This encoder processes image patches at multiple levels/resolutions.\n  - Each stage applies patch merging to go to the next coarser scale, building a hierarchical representation from fine to coarse.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Understanding the relationship between Patch Merging and Hierarchies\n\n- The Patch Merging module is responsible for downsampling feature maps inside the Diffusion Encoder.\n- As input patches are merged, the resolution reduces, allowing the model to capture more global, abstract representations.\n- However, **downsampling generally involves some loss of fine spatial details**, because multiple smaller patches get combined into fewer, larger patches.\n- This loss could degrade the model’s ability to precisely localize small or subtle features that are crucial in medical image segmentation, where fine anatomical boundaries matter significantly.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Contextual clues from the text\n\n- From the context:\n\n  > \"...we empirically suggest the possibility of replacing the latent diffusion encoder with a Swin transformer, which has advantages such as scalability and computational efficiency when processing various images due to its **hierarchical structure**...\"\n\n  > \"...this model architecture enables **accurate segmentation with small, detailed representations** and improves performance...\"\n\nThis implies that while the hierarchical structure of Swin Transformer (with Patch Merging downsampling) benefits efficiency and contextual understanding, there is an inherent trade-off between downsampling and fidelity to fine details.\n\n- The authors incorporate **Reverse Boundary Attention (RBA)** and **morphology-driven learning** (e.g., k-neighbor label smoothing) specifically to **recapture** or emphasize subtle structures and boundaries that might otherwise be lost due to downsampling and hierarchical abstraction.\n\n  > \"...the Reverse Boundary Attention method aims to improve the prediction of segmentation models by gradually capturing and specifying areas that may have been initially ambiguous.\"\n\n- The fact that additional mechanisms are introduced to complement the hierarchical diffusion encoder suggests that **downsampling in Patch Merging can compromise fine-detail retention**, necessitating these compensatory modules.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Directly answering the question\n\n**Q: How could Patch Merging’s downsampling compromise fine-detail retention in Diffusion Encoder hierarchies?**\n\n- ***Patch Merging performs spatial downsampling by aggregating neighboring patches, which reduces the resolution of feature maps in the Diffusion Encoder's hierarchical stages.***\n\n- ***This reduction in spatial resolution inherently causes a loss of spatial granularity and fine details, making it harder to preserve subtle anatomical boundaries and small structures within medical images.***\n\n- ***As a result, while Patch Merging enables efficient global context learning and multi-scale abstraction, it may compromise the accurate representation of fine details necessary for precise segmentation.***\n\n- ***To mitigate this, the model incorporates complementary techniques like Reverse Boundary Attention and morphology-driven label smoothing, which specifically enhance boundary and small structure representation that might be lost due to downsampling.***\n\n---\n\n# **Final concise answer:**\n\nPatch Merging’s downsampling reduces the spatial resolution of feature maps within the Diffusion Encoder hierarchy by combining neighboring patches, which inherently leads to a loss of fine spatial details. This compromises the retention of subtle anatomical features and precise boundaries in medical images, potentially degrading segmentation accuracy for small or detailed structures. Consequently, while downsampling aids efficient hierarchical representation, it risks losing important fine-grained information that the model addresses through additional mechanisms like Reverse Boundary Attention."

Diffusion models add noise to the images progressively, indexed by discrete time steps; time embeddings encode which step the model is currently processing.\n  \n- **Linear Projection** (blue box) is a module that projects the input data (here, image patches) into a feature embedding space suitable for processing by the transformer blocks. This projection turns patch tokens into vectors with dimensions expected by the transformer.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Context about the diffusion model and the encoder\n\n- The **diffusion encoder** in the model is a Swin Transformer-based encoder that takes noisy segmentation maps and other inputs to predict refined segmentations progressively.\n\n- The model uses an iterative denoising process:\n  \n  - At each time step \\(t\\), a noisy version \\(x_t\\) of the segmentation map is input.\n  \n  - The model needs to be conditioned on which step it is in — this is done via **time embeddings**.\n\n- The model also uses **conditional encoding** of the original image through another encoder.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Why integrate time embedding and linear projection before Swin Transformer blocks?\n\n- **Time Embedding Motivation:**\n\n  Diffusion models are inherently time-dependent — the amount of noise varies with step \\(t\\). Thus, the model must understand the current time step to guide the denoising process appropriately. Time embeddings provide this information, conditioning the model on the noise level/stage of denoising.\n\n- **Linear Projection Motivation:**\n\n  The image (and noisy segmentation) is split into patches. These patches are initially raw pixel values or features. To use transformer blocks, patches need to be converted into suitable embedding vectors — a process handled by linear projection. This is a standard preprocessing step in Vision Transformer architectures.\n\n- **Integration before Swin Transformer block:**\n\n  Integrating **time embedding** and **linear projection** before the transformer blocks allows:\n\n  1. The model to condition the patch embeddings on the diffusion time step \\(t\\) — i.e., to be aware of the noise level for each token processed.\n\n  2. Proper embedding of the input data to the dimension needed for the transformer.\n\n  3. Seamless combination of positional and temporal conditioning with the patch features before applying the attention mechanisms inside the Swin Transformer block.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Support from text context\n\n- The text under \"DTS: Diffusion Transformer Segmentation\" mentions:\n\n  > Our method combines information from the current estimate \\(x_t\\), the image \\(c\\), and the time step index \\(t\\) to adjust the step estimate function \\(\\epsilon_\\theta\\) at the input.\n\n- Also:\n\n  > The diffusion process involves adding Gaussian noise incrementally to the segmentation label over a series of steps \\(t\\), and the denoising network is conditioned on \\(t\\).\n\n- The figure caption and explanation show time embedding branching into linear projection before the Swin Transformer block, matching the reasoning above.\n\n---\n\n### **Final answer:**\n\nIntegrating the **time embedding** and **linear projection** before the Swin Transformer blocks in the diffusion encoder allows the model to embed the current diffusion time step \\(t\\) information together with the image patch features into a suitable representation. This conditioning enables the transformer encoder to be explicitly aware of the noise level at each denoising step and process patch embeddings accordingly, improving the denoising and segmentation performance. The linear projection maps the input patch tokens into an appropriate embedding space compatible with the Swin Transformer, ensuring efficient hierarchical attention and feature extraction.\n\n---\n\n# **Answer:**\n\nThe motivation for integrating **time embedding** and **linear projection** before the Swin Transformer blocks in the diffusion encoder is to condition the model on the current diffusion step \\(t\\) by embedding temporal information (time embedding), while simultaneously projecting the input image patches into an appropriate feature space (linear projection) suited for transformer processing. This combined embedding ensures that the Swin Transformer can effectively incorporate the noise level context of each diffusion step along with spatial patch representations, enabling accurate and context-aware denoising during segmentation."

Ultimately, facilitate the model to generate **more precise and accurate segmentation** outputs.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Summary reasoning  \n\n- The motivation for channeling the global feature map through RBA to enhance the diffusion decoder outputs is to **progressively identify and correct ambiguous, overlooked, or incorrect boundaries of organs** in segmentation.  \n- The global feature map contains the overall prediction, but boundary ambiguity remains a challenge.  \n- The RBA helps by focusing attention on unclear or difficult boundary regions, allowing the model to refine the segmentation in an iterative and attentive manner.  \n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe motivation for channeling the global feature map (the output of the diffusion decoder) through Reverse Boundary Attention (RBA) is to progressively identify and refine ambiguous or overlooked organ boundaries.

The query text is highlighted in a red box and reads:  \n     \"USER: Where is the {keypoint} of this object in this image? ...\"  \n- So, the [mask1] refers to the content of the query text box in the support-free approach, which is a text-only query asking for keypoint locations.\n\nStep 2: Understand why the support-free approach would adopt text-only queries rather than image-based support sets. Reference the provided context:  \n- Traditional CAPE methods rely on support images with keypoint annotations of the same category to help localize keypoints in query images. However, this support-dependent approach has drawbacks:  \n   - Relies heavily on support data quality and similarity with query images.  \n   - Risk of overfitting to categories used in training and lack of generalization to novel categories.  \n   - Human annotation for keypoints in support images is time-consuming and inconvenient to update.  \n- Text-based support attempts exist ([22]) that replace support images with sequences of keypoint names, reducing reliance on images but still use some skeletal dependencies and don’t fully match high-shot performance.  \n- The authors propose using a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that leverages detailed text instructions describing keypoints, together with the query image, enabling:  \n   - No need for annotated support images, avoiding dependence on support quality.  \n   - Flexibility to adapt to novel categories by providing detailed textual descriptions rather than relying on visual supports.  \n   - Exploitation of LLM's strong language understanding and reasoning capabilities to predict keypoint locations.  \n   - Simple architecture with fewer practical drawbacks like annotation effort and support data quality variance.  \n- Overall, text-only queries improve generalizability, flexibility, and reduce annotation burden, while utilizing the MLLM's powerful understanding.\n\nStep 3: Summarize the chain of reasoning:  \n- Support-dependent methods rely on image + keypoint annotations which poses issues: overfitting, dependence on support quality, and annotation inconvenience.  \n- Text-based input with MLLMs sidesteps these issues, leveraging language understanding to reason keypoint locations from detailed descriptions without support images.  \n- Hence, adopting a text-only [mask1] query (text description of keypoints) over image-based support sets allows for a simpler, more generalizable, less annotation-dependent CAPE approach with better performance, especially for novel categories.\n\n**Final answer:**  \nThe text-only query (user text prompt describing keypoints) is adopted instead of an image-based support set in CAPE because it eliminates the reliance on support images and their annotations, which are prone to quality issues and cumbersome to obtain. By leveraging detailed textual descriptions processed by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), this approach enables more robust, flexible, and generalizable keypoint estimation for novel categories without the pitfalls of support-dependent methods. This simplifies the architecture, reduces dependence on annotated support data, and exploits the LLM’s strong language comprehension to deliver trustworthy keypoint predictions."

Identify what the [mask1] and [mask2] modules correspond to in the support-dependent CAPE approach.\n   - The red box [mask1] is \"Matching\".\n   - The blue box [mask2] is \"Proposal Generator\".\n\n2. From Figure 1 and the context:\n   - The support-dependent approach uses a support set consisting of images and keypoints.\n   - The query image is matched with the support images/keypoints to find correspondences.\n   - The \"Matching\" module produces similarity scores or matching results between query and support data.\n   - The output from \"Matching\" then feeds into the \"Proposal Generator\" which produces initial keypoint proposals for the query image.\n   - These initial proposals are then refined to generate the final query keypoints.\n\n3.

These results serve as input signals for the Proposal Generator module, which then produces initial keypoint location proposals for the query image by interpreting the matching similarities.\n\n# Final answer:\n\nThe output of the Matching module (red box) consists of similarity scores or correspondences between the query image and the support image-keypoint pairs. These similarity results feed into the Proposal Generator module (blue box), which uses them to generate initial keypoint location proposals on the query image.

For example, \\( d \\) can be the F-ratio between the intra-class or inter-class similarity distributions in synthetic versus real data.\n\n2. **Problem with raw distance \\( d \\):**\n\n   The computed distances \\( d \\) are unbounded and lack normalization, making interpretation and comparison across datasets/domains difficult.\n\n3. **Role of normalization function \\( \\gamma = \\exp(- \\alpha \\cdot d) \\):**\n\n   - This exponential normalization function maps the distance \\( d \\) to a bounded similarity index \\( \\gamma \\in (0, 1] \\).\n   - When \\( d = 0 \\) (ideal case where synthetic and real distributions completely match), \\( \\gamma = \\exp(0) = 1 \\) — indicating perfect diversity alignment.\n   - When \\( d \\) is large (poor diversity alignment), \\( \\gamma \\) approaches 0, signaling poor diversity.\n   - This function effectively **inverts and normalizes** the distance scale into a meaningful, interpretable similarity measure.\n\n4. **Why exponential normalization instead of traditional softmax-based scaling?**\n\n   - **Softmax-based scaling** typically normalizes over a set of values to form a probability distribution (outputs sum to 1). It's usually used when you have multiple competing values and want to assign relative probabilities.\n   - In this context, there is a *single* distance measure \\( d \\) (or pairs of distances \\(d_s, d_r\\)) representing discrepancy between two distributions, and the goal is to get a normalized index that reflects the *absolute* degree of similarity, not a relative probability.\n\n5. **Advantages of exponential normalization here:**\n\n   - **Direct, smooth, and monotonic decay:** The exponential function naturally decays the distance into a similarity score, emphasizing small distances.\n   - **Independent and absolute scaling:** Does not require other values or normalization across multiple distances, unlike softmax.\n   - **Domain-agnostic interpretability:** Provides a bounded, normalized metric between 0 and 1 to be interpreted consistently across domains or datasets.\n   - **Parameter \\(\\alpha\\) controls sensitivity:** Allows tuning how sensitive the similarity score is to changes in \\( d \\).\n\n6. **Summary:**\n\n   The [mask1] (exponential normalization) *leverages a direct, monotonic, bounded normalization of the distance \\( d \\) converting an unbounded distance metric into a readily interpretable similarity/density index*. This improves over traditional softmax-based scaling, which is designed for relative comparisons and probability distributions rather than absolute normalization of scalar distances.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe **SDICE index’s exponential normalization function** leverages a direct and absolute mapping of the unbounded distribution distance \\( d \\) into a bounded similarity index \\( \\gamma \\in (0,1] \\) through the function \\( \\gamma = \\exp(-\\alpha \\cdot d) \\). This contrasts with traditional softmax-based scaling, which normalizes a set of values into a probability distribution for relative comparisons. By using exponential normalization, the SDICE index obtains a smooth, monotonic, and interpretable measure of similarity that reflects how closely the synthetic dataset’s similarity distributions align with those of the reference real dataset. This approach allows for an absolute, domain-agnostic metric of diversity that is sensitive and tunable via parameter \\( \\alpha \\), without requiring normalization across a set of competing distances as softmax does."

Following this, the **D2BR-Conv** blocks operate at multiple downsampled scales within the encoder, where they extract multi-scale features while applying spatial regularization through DropBlock. By randomly dropping contiguous spatial regions in feature maps, D2BR-Conv prevents overfitting and encourages learning robust, discriminative features. The interplay between DWF-Conv's broad, attentive feature extraction and D2BR-Conv’s multi-scale processing with DropBlock regularization enables effective multi-scale feature extraction and robust model generalization throughout the network.\n\n---\n\nIf you want me to simply restate in a concise form, just ask!"

This iterative sampling refines the representation of important spatial regions without dense computation over all patches.\n\n3. **Residual Multi-Branch Attention (RMBA)**:  \n   - After several iterations of superpixel update, RM-SViT applies a multi-branch self-attention mechanism over the superpixels to capture global contextual dependencies. Multi-branch here implies multiple attention \"heads\" or segments capturing diverse feature interactions.  \n   - The weighted attention output is projected through convolutional layers and combined with a residual connection (identity mapping), which stabilizes training, preserves original features, and helps the module learn additive refinements rather than complete transformations.\n\n4. **Combining Sampling and Attention for Context Modeling**:  \n   - The sparse superpixel sampling reduces computational complexity by representing groups of tokens as fewer superpixels, thus enabling efficient global context modeling.  \n   - The residual multi-branch attention then enriches these superpixel features by integrating global dependencies across the superpixels, enhancing the network’s understanding of global scene context.  \n   - The residual connection ensures that the refined features improve upon, rather than override, the previous representations, preventing information loss and facilitating stable training.\n\nTherefore, the RM-SViT balances sparse superpixel sampling and residual multi-branch attention by first reducing the complexity through iterative sparse grouping of tokens into superpixels, then applying multi-branch attention to capture diverse global interactions, and finally using residual connections to merge the refined features with original inputs—striking a balance between computational efficiency and rich context modeling.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe RM-SViT module balances sparse superpixel sampling and residual multi-branch attention by iteratively grouping encoder features into superpixels through sparse relational learning, which efficiently represents key spatial regions. It then applies residual multi-branch self-attention to these superpixels to capture diverse global contextual dependencies while preserving original information via residual connections.

Its shift from **unlabeled-labeled mixing to unlabeled-unlabeled mixing** affects the **consistency loss flow** by:\n\n- **Early stages:** injecting stable label information into the unlabeled augmented inputs for reliable consistency loss computation.\n- **Later stages:** increasing perturbation complexity by mixing unlabeled images, thereby enhancing model generalization and robustness via more challenging consistency supervision.\n\nThis adaptive shift progressively refines the augmentation strategy and consistency loss inputs, ensuring stable yet progressively harder consistency learning.\n\n---\n\n# Final succinct answer:\n\nThe [mask1] Adaptive CutMix module shifts from mixing unlabeled-labeled images early in training to mixing unlabeled-unlabeled images later. This shift causes the consistency loss flow to transition from relying on stable, label-guided supervision for reliable learning to employing stronger perturbations through unlabeled-unlabeled mixing that enhance generalization and robustness. Thus, the consistency loss becomes progressively more challenging and effective at regularizing the model as training proceeds."

Reliance on examples in the prompt could bias the model towards the supplied examples, possibly introducing new biases if the examples are not carefully selected.\n\n2. The counterfactual examples may unintentionally encode or reinforce unwanted perspectives if not balanced or carefully crafted.\n\n3. The approach assumes that biases are adequately represented and captured in the counterfactual examples — if some biases are missed, there might be a false sense of security.\n\n4. The method might suppress certain types of biases but unintentionally overlook others (some biases remain unrecognized).\n\n5. If applied on proprietary models where the internal representation and probabilities are inaccessible (as noted in Limitations), the approach might be less effective or result in unpredictable behaviors, affecting fairness.\n\n6. The few-shot prompts involve telling the model to \"act as an impartial judge,\" which might raise risks if the model still encodes societal biases, leading to biased judgments despite the prompt.\n\n7. Errors in labeling or constructing counterfactual examples might mislead the model.\n\nStep 5: Check if these ethical risks are acknowledged in the text as limitations or concerns.\n\n- The \"Limitations\" state that the approach relies on hidden states and predicted probabilities (black-box models like GPT-4 make this challenging).\n\n- The text does not explicit mention ethical risks of the few-shot method per se.\n\nStep 6: Summary of the answer focused on ethical risks:\n\n- Using few-shot counterfactual ICL for bias suppression involves embedding counterfactual examples in prompts to reduce bias.\n\n- Ethical risks include dependency on the quality and representativeness of these counterfactual examples — poor or biased examples can reinforce or introduce new biases.\n\n- There is also risk of incomplete debiasing if some biases are missed.\n\n- The method’s effectiveness is limited on closed models where internal signals are inaccessible, possibly resulting in opaque or inefficient debiasing.\n\n- Biases in the examples or prompts might propagate unintentional stereotypes or unfair judgments.\n\nTherefore, the ethical risks involve potential introduction or reinforcement of bias through imperfect examples, incomplete debiasing, overreliance on prompt design, and limitations in applicability to closed-source models.\n\n# Final answer:\n\nUsing the few-shot counterfactual ICL method ([mask1]) for ICL-based bias suppression ([mask2]) carries ethical risks primarily related to the dependency on the quality, representativeness, and neutrality of the supplied counterfactual examples. If these examples are biased, incomplete, or improperly constructed, they may inadvertently introduce new biases or reinforce existing ones in the LLM’s generations. Additionally, relying on prompt-based debiasing assumes that all relevant biases are captured, so overlooked or unrecognized biases remain unmitigated, posing risks of unfair or harmful outputs. Furthermore, because this method requires access to internal model signals for selecting informative biased instances, it is less effective or inapplicable to proprietary, black-box models, which limits comprehensive bias identification and correction. Finally, instructing LLMs to “act as impartial judges” may not fully eliminate embedded societal biases, raising concerns about residual biased judgments despite the debiasing attempts."

It shows how pairs of instances that violate the causal invariance principle are identified — meaning their representations are similar (biased info is shared) but their true semantic outputs differ, which indicates bias captured by the model.\n\n- The **blue box** surrounds the **whole framework**, of which the red box is **a foundational component** responsible for identifying biased instances. The blue box further includes:\n\n  - The selection of **informative biased instances** (filtering for those with significant bias influence)\n  - Clustering and inducing explainable bias patterns based on representation vectors of biased instances\n  - The **ICL-based Bias Suppression methods** that use the induced bias patterns and counterfactual examples to regularize the LLM.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: From the textual context, what motivates integrating [mask1] into [mask2]?\n\n- From the text (Methodology and Context sections):\n\n  1. The **core problem** is that large language models (LLMs) are biased due to dataset biases captured during pretraining.\n\n  2. Identifying these dataset biases automatically is challenging, especially for generative LLMs.\n\n  3. To tackle this, the authors propose a **causal-guided active learning framework** ([mask2]) which leverages the **causal invariance principle** to identify biased instances — that is, [mask1].\n\n  4. The motivation to integrate the **causal invariance-based biased instance identification ([mask1])** into the **larger active learning framework ([mask2])** is:\n\n      - To **automatically detect** biased instances rather than relying on manual or prior knowledge of biases (which is impractical due to diverse and unknown biases).\n      - To use these identified biased instances as the basis for **selecting the most informative samples**, inducing interpretable bias patterns, and feeding these to an in-context learning (ICL) regularization method.\n      - This integration exploits the **causal invariance property** to disentangle true semantic information from dataset bias, enabling accurate identification of where the model relies on bias.\n      - Without this identification step ([mask1]), the active learning framework cannot systematically find bias and thus cannot induce effective debiasing strategies.\n\n  5. In essence, **causal invariance based biased instance identification is the key trigger and foundation within the broader active learning framework to enable automatic and explainable bias detection and subsequent suppression**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Summarize the answer\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe motivation for integrating **causal invariance-based biased instance identification** ([mask1]) into the **causal-guided active learning framework** ([mask2]) is to enable the automatic and principled detection of biased instances by leveraging the causal invariance property. This step is essential for disentangling semantic information from dataset biases in generative LLMs. By identifying instances where the model’s representations violate causal invariance—indicating reliance on bias—the framework can then select the most informative biased samples, induce explainable bias patterns, and apply efficient debiasing methods such as in-context learning. This integration addresses the challenge of unknown and diverse dataset biases without relying on prior manual knowledge, allowing the active learning framework to effectively discover, explain, and mitigate biases in LLMs.\n\n---\n\n# Final Answer:\n\nThe integration of **causal invariance-based biased instance identification** into the **causal-guided active learning framework** is motivated by the need to automatically and reliably detect biased instances through violations of causal invariance. This detection serves as the foundation for selecting informative biased instances, inducing explainable bias patterns, and subsequently regularizing the model with in-context learning, thereby enabling an effective, automatic, and explainable debiasing process for generative large language models."

Also, if the generations for the pair are similar (suggesting a typical pattern of bias).  \n     - **Influential Criteria:** Require that for a counter example pair, the model generation is proper (not totally wrong) on at least one instance of the pair, to ensure the model did capture predictive information to some degree.\n\n2. **Why combine Typical and Influential criteria?**  \n   - The Influential Criterion helps rule out pairs where the model generation is poor on both instances, indicating no predictive information is captured (so these pairs are not useful for bias identification).  \n   - The Typical Criterion helps focus on instances with significant bias influence (low generation probability) and typical bias patterns (similar influence on both instances).  \n   - Combining them narrows down the counterexample pairs to those that are both informative (contain strong bias signals) and meaningful (where the model is actually making proper/useful predictions on at least one instance).  \n\n3. **Purpose of combining these:**  \n   - To select a subset of biased instances that are both informative and representative of typical biases. This facilitates better bias pattern induction because:  \n     - It excludes noisy or uninformative instances where no predictive learning happened.  \n     - It avoids overly diverse bias effects that are hard to summarize (by focusing on pairs with similar generation influence).  \n     - It allows summarizing explainable and coherent bias patterns for debiasing.\n\n4. **Evidence from the diagram pipeline:**  \n   - The causal invariance identifies all biased instances (many).  \n   - Then, the \"Informative Biased Instances Selection and Bias Pattern Induction\" box shows the selection using Typical and Influential criteria.  \n   - After that, clustering and summarization are done on this curated set, which leads to effective bias pattern induction.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThey are combined because the Influential Criterion filters out instances where the model does not capture any predictive information (ensuring the identified biased instances are meaningful), while the Typical Criterion selects instances that contain significant and representative bias influence (making them informative). Combining these criteria allows for selection of a subset of biased instances that are both informative and reliable for inducing clear and explainable bias patterns, thereby improving the quality and effectiveness of bias pattern induction.\n\n---\n\n**Final concise answer:**  \nThe Typical Criteria (highlighted by [mask1]) and the Influential Criteria are combined for informative biased instances selection and bias pattern induction to ensure that the selected subset of biased instances is both informative—containing strong and typical bias influence—and meaningful—where the model actually captures predictive information. This combination filters out noisy or uninformative pairs and focuses on reliable, representative biased instances, enabling the induction of clear and explainable bias patterns for effective debiasing."

During denoising, the DAE receives **masked agent representations** with some agents' features randomly hidden. It uses the causal graph to propagate information only between causally related agents, enabling it to reconstruct (denoise) the masked features from the unmasked causal parents. This approach allows the DAE to recover the masked temporal agent representations effectively by exploiting the causal dependencies encoded in the graph, ensuring the learned representations capture true causal interactions among agents.\n\n---\n\n### Summary (concise):\n\nThe **Denoising Autoencoder (DAE)** uses the *causal graph* inferred by the Causal Discovery Network to guide information propagation in its graph convolutional layers, reconstructing (denoising) masked agent representations based only on their causally related neighbors. This causal-guided denoising helps the model learn faithful agent representations aligned with causal dependencies."

This design restricts back-propagation to the transform-neck and the partial encoder, bypassing the prohibitively expensive gradient flow through the full, billion-scale MLLM and enabling efficient joint training of the image codec and transform-neck without involving the huge MLLM."

When depth data is sparse or noisy, this alignment suffers, leading to degraded accuracy in the 3D representation of parts and objects.

This detailed reconstruction could expose private spaces and objects.\n\n2. **Semantic and Part-Level Recognition:**  \n   Since the method associates semantic features (object names, part names) with explicit 3D locations, it could infer user habits, object usage, or presence of sensitive or personal items.\n\n3. **Persistent Data Capture and Storage:**  \n   The system stores a detailed 3D model with semantic labels that might be retained or transmitted externally, raising concerns about who has access and how this data is secured.\n\n4. **Real-time Tracking and Editing:**  \n   The approach supports dynamic scene changes and real-time tracking of objects. Continuous tracking could amount to surveillance, revealing movement patterns, behaviors, or interactions within private spaces.\n\n5. **Multiple Cameras and Multi-view Fusion:**  \n   Because it uses multiple calibrated cameras (like home-installed RGBD cameras), this raises risks of unconsented continuous monitoring and data aggregation beyond a single viewpoint.\n\n6. **Inferential Privacy Risks:**  \n   Semantic enrichment may enable inference of sensitive information not explicit in raw images, such as identifying personal belongings or habits.\n\n7. **Potential for Misuse:**  \n   Detailed 3D environment reconstructions could be misused if accessed maliciously, for identity theft, stalking, or unauthorized surveillance.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Answer\n\nThe ethical concerns that feature splatting raises in privacy-sensitive environments stem from its capability to create detailed 3D reconstructions enriched with semantic and part-level information from multi-view images. This can lead to potential invasions of privacy by capturing and persistently storing detailed spatial and semantic data about private spaces and personal belongings. Moreover, real-time tracking of objects and movements heightens surveillance risks, while multi-camera setups could result in continuous and comprehensive monitoring. Finally, security and data governance challenges arise regarding who can access these rich 3D semantic maps, which may reveal sensitive personal information if mishandled or misused.\n\n---\n\n**Final concise answer:**\n\nFeature Splatting raises ethical concerns in privacy-sensitive environments by enabling detailed 3D reconstruction and semantic labeling of private spaces, potentially exposing sensitive objects and user behaviors. The persistent storage and real-time tracking of such data risk unauthorized surveillance and privacy invasion, especially when multiple cameras and detailed semantic features are involved. Ensuring secure data handling and mitigating surveillance risks are critical ethical considerations for deploying such technology in private settings."

It reconstructs the original branch’s features from the low-frequency and high-frequency branch features in latent space, pushing the network to learn complementary and comprehensive feature representations.\n\n### Step 3: Why combine these two during meta-learning regularization?\n\nThe combination of \\([mask1]\\) (feature embeddings) and \\([mask2]\\) (prediction scores) in the regularization process serves a joint purpose:\n\n- **Prediction consistency (red box):** By minimizing KL divergence on prediction scores, the model is forced to produce similar task-specific predictions irrespective of frequency decomposition. This enforces domain-invariant output behavior, which is important because the frequency-based decomposition captures different image aspects that remain consistent across domains.\n\n- **Feature reconstruction (blue box):** Reconstructing original features from low- and high-frequency features encourages the model to learn complementary and detailed latent representations capturing both coarse content and fine structure. This strengthens the model's internal feature space, which supports better generalization.\n\nEffectively, combining [mask1] and [mask2] guides the network both at the **feature representation level** and the **prediction output level**, helping alleviate overfitting to domain-specific signals by enforcing *cross-domain invariant frequency priors*.\n\n### Step 4: Summary answer\n\nWe combine the features ([mask1]) and prediction scores ([mask2]) during meta-learning regularization because:\n\n1. The prediction consistency prior operates on [mask2], aligning output predictions across decomposed frequency components and the original domain, ensuring domain-invariant predictions.\n\n2. The feature reconstruction prior operates on [mask1], using the complementary low- and high-frequency features to reconstruct original features, encouraging rich, comprehensive feature embeddings.\n\nTogether, this joint regularization across both feature embeddings and prediction distributions enables the model to learn complementary, domain-invariant representations and consistent predictions that improve cross-domain generalization and reduce overfitting during meta-learning.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nWe combine [mask1] (the feature embeddings from the frequency branches) and [mask2] (the prediction scores) during meta-learning regularization to jointly enforce complementary and invariant learning constraints. Specifically, aligning prediction scores across original, low-, and high-frequency components ([mask2]) ensures prediction consistency and domain invariance, while reconstructing original features from low- and high-frequency features ([mask1]) encourages comprehensive, complementary feature representation. This joint regularization effectively alleviates over-fitting and improves cross-domain generalization by capturing both detailed and coarse information at the feature and prediction levels."

The output of this adapter is then **scaled** by the corresponding dynamically generated scaling factor \\( \\alpha_l \\), and added back to the token embeddings. This dynamic scaling allows the adapter to efficiently use the vision-aligned prior to modulate the feed-forward transformation in each language block, facilitating alignment and adaptation between visual and textual modalities while maintaining efficient tuning.\n\n---\n\nThis explanation aligns the visual red box content with detailed operations outlined in the context, completing the understanding of how [mask1] computes and applies scaling factors using the vision-aligned prior across language blocks."

The criteria for ending interaction ([mask1]) act as predefined stopping signals or phrases that the LLM-based counselor uses to determine when to conclude the interaction with the client during simulation.\n\n2. In curriculum learning, stopping conditions help guide training by signaling when a model has mastered a certain level or when a task session should terminate.\n\n3. Similarly, these ending interaction criteria serve as stopping conditions that guide the counselor’s conversational flow, ensuring conversations do not run indefinitely and align with realistic counseling behavior.\n\n4. By implementing these criteria during the data collection phase (interactive simulation), the system collects high-quality dialogues that end naturally and appropriately, which are then compiled into a corpus.\n\n5. This filtered, quality-controlled corpus is used for model training ([mask2]), enabling the LLM-based counselor to learn appropriate session endings and dialogue structures.\n\nHence, the ending interaction criteria guide the LLM-based counselor model by defining explicit and realistic stopping conditions during dialogue simulation. This mechanism is analogous to curriculum learning’s stopping rules by regulating when the conversational agent concludes an interaction, helping to generate coherent, focused, and realistic counseling dialogues that can effectively train the counselor model."

This component involves constructing a diverse pool of clients based on user profiles, which are detailed descriptions of mental health issues extracted from long user posts on an online professional psychological platform.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning about how Client Pool selection influences Dialogue diversity during data collection:\n\n1. The Client Pool is built from 1000 different user posts, each representing a unique user profile that describes a client's mental health problems, symptoms, disorders, and chief complaints.\n\n2. These distinct client profiles serve as inputs to the LLM-based client simulation, meaning the simulated clients embody various issues and conversational styles reflecting real-world diversity.\n\n3. During interactive simulation, each unique client profile interacts with the LLM-based counselor to generate dialogue sessions. Because profiles differ significantly, the conversations naturally vary in topic, depth, emotional content, and style.\n\n4. This diversity in the client profiles therefore directly translates into diversity in the dialogues generated during data collection. The dialogue sessions cover a broad range of mental health topics and concerns, closely mimicking real client-counselor interactions.\n\n5. The paper's evaluation (Section 3.1) supports this: topic distribution and information entropy analyses show that the SimPsyDial dataset (from the simulated dialogues) exhibits a broad and diverse range of topics, which is close to that of real-world counseling dialogues (RealPsyDial).\n\nIn summary, the selection and construction of a diverse Client Pool with rich and varied user profiles are fundamental to ensuring dialogue diversity during data collection. The heterogeneity of clients' mental health issues shapes the variation and richness of simulated counseling conversations."

In this context, the most relevant F/T information pertains to the force or torque opposing the robot’s actions, as they provide direct feedback on the resistance encountered during manipulation. Based on this observation, we reduce our F/T perception interface to include only resistance force and torque.",

We then provide a plot of the selected signal and prompt the LLM to update success condition functions accordingly. An example of the resulting function is_inserted for the task of mounting cable to clips is shown in Fig. 3 (c).

The raw six-dimensional F/T signals are complex, so the system simplifies this to relevant resistance force and torque opposing the robot's actions.\n\n- **Demo Task Plan**:  \n  This is the output of the bootstrapped reasoning pipeline combining skill sequences and their refined conditions (including success conditions). Specifically, after skill sequence reasoning and success condition reasoning (including applying F/T signals), the system assembles the demonstration task plan. It acts as an example or template for planning new tasks and is key to ensuring execution success and generalizability.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: How does integrating \"Skill F/T Signals\" refine success conditions in the \"Demo Task Plan\"?\n\nFrom the context (section III-B, \"Reasoning Skill Conditions\" and IV-B Evaluation):\n\n- Initially, the LLM generates success condition functions based on the skill library and visual/tactile data.\n- However, success conditions depend especially on accurately detecting when a skill has succeeded.\n- The F/T signals provide essential, nuanced feedback on whether the manipulation actions have truly succeeded by indicating resistance forces or torque thresholds.\n- The LLM uses these F/T signals to refine and update the threshold values in these success conditions. This is done by observing the plotted signals and adjusting the numeric threshold parameters defining success.\n- For example, for the \"insert\" skill, the success condition \"is_inserted\" is defined as the resistance force falling below a set threshold, indicating the cable is fully inserted.\n- Incorporating F/T improves the robustness and reliability of the success conditions. It prevents errors or failures that might happen if success was determined solely by visual or tactile data without force feedback.\n- As a result, refined success conditions based on F/T signals enable the Demo Task Plan to be more executable, adaptive, and generalizable to new tasks and scenarios.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Summary of chain-of-thought reasoning\n\n- The demo task plan relies on a sequence of skills and their success conditions.\n- Success conditions need to be accurate to ensure the robot knows when a skill has successfully completed.\n- Skill F/T signals provide critical quantitative feedback about physical resistance during manipulation.\n- The LLM learns to incorporate these F/T signals into the success condition functions by specifying which signals to monitor and appropriate threshold values.\n- This refinement improves the detection of task success, leading to more reliable and executable plans that form the Demo Task Plan.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nIntegrating **Skill F/T Signals** refines the success conditions in the **Demo Task Plan** by providing critical force and torque feedback that the LLM uses to update numerical thresholds in success condition functions. This feedback allows the demonstration task plan to more accurately and reliably detect the completion of manipulation skills by monitoring resistance forces and torques, thereby enhancing the robustness and executability of the skill transitions and the overall task plan."

Identify the entities for [mask1] and [mask2] using image-text alignment:\n   - [mask1] corresponds to the content highlighted by a red box in the image, which is labeled \"Skip Dropout\" (SD).\n   - [mask2] corresponds to the content highlighted by a blue box in the image, which is labeled \"Feature Extractor\" (FE).\n\n2. Understand the roles of Skip Dropout (SD) and Feature Extractor (FE) from the context:\n   - The Feature Extractor (blue box) extracts disentangled latent units representing intrinsic factors from the input images.\n   - These latent units are then used as conditional input features for the diffusion model (Diffusion U-Net).\n   - Thus, the feature extractor provides semantic features for disentanglement.\n\n3. Understand the role of Skip Dropout (SD) from the context and figure caption:\n   - SD is an architectural modification that selectively drops the skip connection features from the noisy image input inside the diffusion U-Net.\n   - This makes the diffusion U-Net focus less on the skip connection path (which carries noisy image data) and more on the latent unit features coming from the feature extractor.\n   - The goal of SD is to encourage the diffusion U-Net to rely more on the conditions generated by the feature extractor for image generation and denoising.\n\n4. Analyze how [mask1] (Skip Dropout) might compromise the balance between [mask2] (Feature Extractor) and diffusion U-Net:\n   - The diffusion U-Net receives two main inputs: one through skip connections (noisy image features) and another through cross-attention (features from the feature extractor).\n   - If skip dropout drops too much or improperly, the diffusion U-Net might overly rely on the latent feature extractor condition, or conversely, might ignore it if SD is absent or weak.\n   - If the SD mechanism is too aggressive or improperly balanced, it might degrade the U-Net's capacity to combine information from both paths effectively.\n   - This imbalance could impede proper complementary learning between the feature extractor and diffusion U-Net, making one dominate or the other ignored.\n   - Such imbalance risks the diffusion model drifting toward unconditional generation or neglecting disentanglement cues from features.\n\n5. Impact on methodology fairness:\n   - \"Fairness\" here likely refers to the fair and balanced training of both the feature extractor and diffusion U-Net to achieve disentanglement.\n   - If SD compromises this balance, the feature extractor might not be sufficiently trained to produce meaningful disentangled latent units, or the diffusion U-Net might not leverage them properly.\n   - This could lead to poorer disentanglement performance and less interpretable latent representations, undermining the methodology's fairness and effectiveness.\n\nFinal answer:\n\nThe Skip Dropout ([mask1]) technique modifies the diffusion U-Net by stochastically dropping skip connection features from the noisy image pathway to encourage the network to focus on latent units conditioned by the Feature Extractor ([mask2]). However, if Skip Dropout disrupts the balance too strongly—either by excessively dropping skip features or insufficiently guiding reliance on the feature extractor—it can cause the diffusion U-Net and feature extractor to fail in learning complementarily. This imbalance may lead the diffusion model to ignore the latent features or treat the training as unconditional generation, thereby compromising fair and effective joint training. Consequently, the methodology’s fairness and disentanglement performance may degrade due to an improper balance between latent unit conditioning and noisy image feature processing."

This is done to make boundaries between attributes more distinct.\n- Importantly, rather than fully aligning features to the means, a controlled interpolation is done (\\(\\alpha\\)-weighted shift), avoiding excessive distortion.\n- This shifting ensures that features corresponding to different attributes/factors are well-separated in latent space, which facilitates disentanglement.\n- The text clarifies that features at boundaries are sensitive and need subtle adjustment to keep training stable.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Answering the Question about the rationale behind applying Feature Alignment ([mask1])\n\n- The rationale is to **enforce attribute separation** by \"pulling\" each feature latent vector closer to the mean (anchor) representing a specific attribute cluster.\n- This makes the clusters in latent space more compact and distinct, clearly delineating different intrinsic factors or attributes.\n- Without this, features might overlap or be ambiguous, making disentanglement difficult.\n- The alignment reduces ambiguity of latent representations, ensuring each latent unit corresponds well to one intrinsic factor.\n- It also addresses instability caused by features near decision boundaries, preventing the diffusion model from learning unconditional generation or unstable mappings.\n- The interpolation strategy prevents excessive shifts that might destabilize training.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe **rationale** for applying *Feature Alignment* ([mask1]) within Dynamic Gaussian Anchoring is to enforce distinct boundaries between latent attribute clusters by shifting each feature latent unit toward the mean of its associated Gaussian anchor.

By probabilistically dropping channels with stronger activations, this mechanism encourages reliance on a wider, more distributed set of features, which smoothens the output feature distribution. Consequently, this smoothing and diversification improve the generated adversarial examples' transferability across different black-box models. Applying this before computing the joint classification loss ensures that the optimization process generates perturbations robust to feature drop variations, thus producing more generalizable adversarial perturbations.**\n\n---\n\n# **Summary Answer:**\n\nThe weighted feature drop is integrated on the deep-layer feature map before the joint classification loss computation to prevent the perturbation optimization from overfitting to a limited set of dominant features. By randomly dropping channels with higher activations, the mechanism forces the adversarial perturbation to focus on a broader set of features, smoothing deep-layer outputs. This smoothing enhances the generalization and transferability of adversarial examples to black-box models by ensuring that the perturbations are robust against variations in key features, effectively improving targeted adversarial attack success in black-box scenarios."

Identify [mask2]: The content highlighted by a blue box in the image is \"Active progressive multi-modal pretraining.\"\n3. So the question is:  \n   **How is Ring attention integrated at each context length expansion during Active progressive multi-modal pretraining?**\n\n4. From the provided context about the progressive training strategy and Active progressive multimodal pretraining:  \n   - The training strategy progressively scales the model's context length through 4K, 32K, 128K, and 512K tokens.  \n   - Positional encodings are scaled up to 50 million (RoPE with 50M) for large contexts.  \n   - For context lengths exceeding 128K during training, RingAttention is employed for QKV (query, key, value) attention computation.  \n   - RingAttention is specifically designed to address memory bottlenecks caused by the quadratic complexity of attention weights with long sequences.  \n   - It segments QKV along the sequence length dimension into blocks (n*block_size) and computes attention iteratively for each block, enabling full attention on very long sequences but with more manageable memory requirements.\n\n5. Therefore, during the progressive context length expansion training:  \n   - Initially, shorter contexts like 4K and 32K may use standard attention methods.  \n   - When the context length grows beyond 128K tokens, RingAttention is integrated as the mechanism to compute attention effectively and efficiently over such very long contexts.  \n   - This means at each enlargement step (128K and then 512K), RingAttention replaces or supplements the usual attention to handle memory and compute issues related to extremely long sequences.\n\n**In summary:**  \nDuring the Active progressive multi-modal pretraining (progressive training strategy from 4K to 512K context lengths), RingAttention is integrated starting from the context length of 128K and onwards to compute QKV attention efficiently for long contexts. It splits the QKV tensors along the sequence dimension into blocks and computes attention iteratively over these blocks, allowing the model to scale to very long context lengths without running into memory bottlenecks.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nRing attention is integrated during active progressive multi-modal pretraining by employing it for QKV attention computation starting at context lengths greater than 128K tokens. It segments the QKV matrices along the sequence length dimension into blocks and iteratively computes full attention for each block. This approach addresses the quadratic memory cost of standard attention, enabling the model to effectively and efficiently handle increasingly longer context lengths (128K to 512K) during each stage of the progressive context length expansion."

It shows the processing of an input image by padding and resizing to 336x336, then splitting into patches named Patch 1, Patch 2, Patch 3, each sized 336x336, and matched to different sets of patches like {2x2, 1x{2,3,4}, {2,3,4}x1} patches. This step happens before passing the processed patches into the Vision encoder.\n\n2. **From the context about Dynamic Vision Encoding:**  \n   - OmChat adopts a technique called **AnyRes**, cited from Liu et al. (2024e), which supports images and videos of **any resolution** by dynamically adjusting the processing pipeline.\n   - The idea is to handle **images with varying resolutions** so the system can still process them effectively without losing details, especially small objects in high-res images.\n   - To achieve this, the model pads and resizes all images to a fixed resolution (336x336 in this case) before matching them to a flexible patch grid.\n   - Patch configurations are dynamically matched to accommodate different input resolutions. Specifically, the patches can vary among patterns like 2x2, 1x{2,3,4}, or {2,3,4}x1, meaning variable numbers and shapes of patches to cover the image adequately.\n   - This flexible patching allows preservation of important image details, avoids losing information due to fixed patch size or shape, and smooths the input for the vision encoder.\n\n3. **Bringing it together:**  \n   The dynamic vision encoding process **pads and resizes the input image to a fixed size (336x336)**, then **dynamically partitions the image into patches of varying configurations** (2x2, 1x{2,3,4}, or {2,3,4}x1 patches). This **adaptation** ensures the model can flexibly handle different input resolutions by adjusting how the image is split into patches before passing these to the vision encoder. This prevents loss of small object details and maintains high performance across inputs of diverse sizes.\n\n### Final answer:  \nThe dynamic vision encoding adapts patch configurations to diverse input resolutions by first padding and resizing the input image to a fixed resolution of 336x336 and then dynamically matching the image to variable patch configurations, such as 2x2, 1x{2,3,4}, or {2,3,4}x1 patches.

This progressive increase helps the model learn longer context handling step-by-step without losing short-context proficiency.\n\n2. **Role of \"Ring attention\":**  \n   In both the text and figure, Ring attention is used **during the training phase for contexts exceeding 128K tokens in length**. It is introduced to manage the memory constraints of attention computation that grows quadratically with sequence length.\n\n3. **How \"Ring attention\" works:**  \n   The text explains Ring attention segments the QKV (query, key, value) tensors along the sequence length dimension into blocks of size n*block_size, and attention is computed iteratively over these blocks. This block-wise attention reduces memory usage and computational complexity, making it feasible to process very long sequences efficiently.\n\n4. **Integration of Ring attention into Active progressive multi-modal pretraining:**  \n   Active progressive multi-modal pretraining scales up context length gradually while using Ring attention for the attention mechanism beyond a certain context length (128K).

Specifically, as the model progressively scales context length from 4K up to 512K tokens, Ring attention is employed for computing the QKV attention when the context length exceeds 128K tokens. Ring attention addresses the quadratic memory complexity of standard attention by segmenting sequences into blocks and calculating attention iteratively, thus making long-context processing computationally feasible and memory-efficient during training.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\nThe active progressive multi-modal pretraining integrates Ring attention by progressively scaling the model’s context length from 4K up to 512K tokens while using Ring attention for contexts longer than 128K tokens. Ring attention efficiently computes QKV attention by dividing the sequence into blocks and iteratively calculating attention for each block, which reduces memory usage and computational complexity. This method enables efficient long-context handling during the multimodal pretraining phase, supporting large-scale context processing without prohibitive resource demands."

This scaling process emphasizes important channels and suppresses less useful ones, effectively implementing channel-wise attention similar to other SE blocks used in prior research.\n\n6. **Resulting Effect:**\n   This mechanism allows the network to focus on the most informative features across channels, improving its capability to discriminate facial emotions.\n\nIn summary, the highlighted \"Squeeze and Excitation Network\" leverages GAP outputs by compressing spatial information into channel-wise descriptors, then uses fully connected layers to learn attention weights. These weights scale the original feature maps, thereby implementing channel-wise attention analogous to previously established attention modules."

The context text confirms that this corresponds to the CNN backbone for simple feature extraction from images.\n\nStep 2: Understand the role of \"Simple Feature Extraction\" according to the context.\n\nThe CNN backbone extracts high-level feature maps from the input facial images using convolution blocks and batch normalization. This creates initial spatial features that are concatenated and then passed through a max-pooling layer for refinement before moving on to subsequent layers in the network.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the interaction described between the simple features and the Residual Network.\n\nAccording to the context, after simple features are extracted, they are passed through a Squeeze and Excitation Network to enhance channel-wise attention. The refined features then enter the Residual Network, which consists of Residual Blocks with weight layers, ReLU activations, and skip connections.\n\nThe Residual Network learns residual functions that model differences between input and output rather than direct mappings.

These features are refined and made more expressive through the Residual Network layers, which iteratively learn residual functions on top of the extracted simple spatial features.\n\nStep 5: Reason about how this facilitates deep feature refinement following ResNet design principles.\n\n- The simple features provide initial high-level representations of the input image.\n- Residual blocks use these initial features as inputs and learn residual mappings to highlight subtle, complex features important for emotion recognition.\n- Skip connections within residual blocks allow the network to retain original simple feature information while progressively refining features.\n- This design addresses vanishing gradients, enabling deeper network architecture and better generalization.\n- Overall, this process results in refined, complex features crucial for accurate classification.\n\nFinal answer:\n\nThe \"Simple Feature Extraction\" layer, representing the CNN backbone, produces foundational high-level feature maps from input images. These simple features serve as inputs to the Residual Network layers, which utilize residual blocks with weight layers, ReLU activations, and skip connections to iteratively learn residual functions that model the difference between input and output features.

In the diagram, the red-boxed content is labeled as:\n\n- **Binary Classification Verifier**\n\nThis verifier uses traditional binary labels (correct/wrong) for supervision during training and inference.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the role of the Binary Classification Verifier ([mask1]) in the context\n\n- From the context, traditional verifiers are trained with **binary supervision**, either:\n  - **Outcome supervision** (labeling entire paths as correct or incorrect)\n  - **Process supervision** (evaluating each step as correct or incorrect).\n\n- These verifiers are represented by the binary classification verifier in the figure.\n\n- During training and inference, the Binary Classification Verifier uses this binary feedback to rank or verify candidate paths generated by the language model.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Contrast with Preference-based Verifier (Tree-PLV)\n\n- The context discusses moving away from binary labels to a **preference-based verifier** using **preference learning**, which ranks pairs of reasoning paths or steps rather than classifying them as simply correct or incorrect.\n\n- Advantages of preference-based verifier mentioned include:\n  - **Step-level granular validation** capturing subtle differences between solutions.\n  - **Robustness to noisy labels**, since it only cares about relative ranking, making it less sensitive to label noise.\n  - **Better alignment with best-of-N ranking evaluation setup.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Identify the limitations that arise when replacing the Binary Classification Verifier with Preference-based Verifier, specifically in reasoning trees.\n\n- The question asks for limitations **when replacing the Binary Classification Verifier with the Preference-based Verifier**.\n\n- However, from the provided context, the **Preference-based Verifier (Tree-PLV)** is presented as strictly **superior**, addressing the limitations of binary classification verifiers, not producing limitations.\n\n- The context highlights **limitations of Binary Classification Verifier**:\n  1. Coarse binary labels do not provide fine-grained feedback.\n  2. Unable to rank candidate paths effectively.\n  3. Vulnerable to label noise.\n  4. Misses subtle stepwise differences.\n\n- On the other hand, the Preference-based Verifier overcomes these.\n\n- Therefore, the context **does not discuss any limitations of the Preference-based Verifier** or any downsides when replacing the Binary Classification Verifier with it.\n\n- The diagram and text seem to only showcase benefits of moving to Preference-based Verifier and do not mention any disadvantages or limitations of this replacement.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Conclude\n\nSince the context only discusses the strengths of the Preference-based Verifier (Tree-PLV) over binary classification verifiers and does not mention any limitations or drawbacks arising from replacing the Binary Classification Verifier with a Preference-based Verifier in reasoning trees, **there are no specified limitations regarding this replacement found in the provided context.**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n**No limitations are reported or discussed in the context when replacing the Binary Classification Verifier ([mask1]) with a Preference-based Verifier in reasoning trees. Instead, the Preference-based Verifier is presented as an improvement, providing more granular, robust, and explainable verification compared to binary classifiers.**"

This spatial re-arrangement enables local accumulation (combining shifted results between registers) to merge multiple bitwise segmentation steps, dramatically reducing the segmentation overhead of SLBC execution.\n\n### Final answer:\n\nThe \"Reordered Packing\" reduces segmentation overhead in SLBC execution by rearranging the packing order of convolution elements so that the overlapping boundary elements appear in corresponding lanes of adjacent SIMD registers rather than between lanes within the same register. This enables these boundary elements to be combined using parallel right-shift and addition operations (local accumulation) across registers, which merges multiple segmentation bitwise operations into fewer steps. Consequently, the number of segmentation operations is significantly reduced—down to a fraction (e.g., 1/ number of SIMD lanes) of the original count—thereby substantially lowering the segmentation overhead in SLBC."

The red box in the figure encloses the \"Search Space\" section, which specifies possible quantization bitwidth values \\( w, a \\in \\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\} \\) for weights and activations.

NAS-based hardware-aware quantization methods typically focus on searching over quantization bitwidth settings to balance accuracy and resource constraints, starting from a predefined search space.\n\n4.

Unlike methods that may not explicitly model operator efficiency or packing constraints, this approach incorporates a performance loss reflecting the efficiency of the implemented low-bitwidth operators (enabled by the SLBC packing approach). The quantization configuration is therefore influenced directly by the search space of bitwidth options, combined with consideration of hardware performance modeled alongside accuracy.\n\n6.

This shows a weight map \\(\\mathcal{W}_i\\), indicating how pixel noise levels are adjusted during denoising based on the viewing angle.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning using the details from the context:\n\n1. **Goal:** The refinement stage aims to improve the quality and view-consistency of textures on the disentangled 3D meshes (body and garments).\n\n2. **Challenge:** Naively using SDEdit for texture enhancement leads to sharper textures but inconsistent results across multiple views because of noise and varying observation qualities.\n\n3. **Improvement 1 — Cross-View Attention (Red Box, [mask1]):**\n\n   - To ensure consistent texture style across different camera views, the method replaces the self-attention mechanism in the diffusion model with cross-view attention.\n\n   - During the denoising process, latent features from canonical and previous views are concatenated to compute keys and values for attention, allowing the model to use multi-view contextual information for consistency.\n\n   - The red box's illustration shows camera views and the dashed arrows indicating attentional links among views for texture style consistency.\n\n4. **Improvement 2 — Incident-Angle-Weighted Denoising (IAW-DE) (Blue Box, [mask2]):**\n\n   - Each pixel in a rendered view has an associated incident-angle weight \\(\\mathcal{W}_i\\), calculated as the cosine similarity between the surface normal and the reversed camera viewing direction.\n\n   - Regions observed more directly (i.e., with a surface normal closer to perpendicular to the camera) have higher weights, which suggests higher confidence in texture information.\n\n   - The IAW-DE strategy adds more noise to higher-weighted pixels during noising and dedicates more denoising steps to these regions, improving texture quality where observation is most reliable.\n\n5. **How [mask1] leverages [mask2]:**\n\n   - The red box mechanism ([mask1]) uses multiple views connected via cross-view attention to enforce style consistency.\n\n   - The blue box method ([mask2]) helps these views focus on refining the texture in areas observed most directly and reliably by weighting noise and denoising accordingly.\n\n   - Combining these, for each view in the sequence, IAW-DE produces refined texture images \\( \\hat{\\mathcal{V}}_i \\) that become pseudo-labels to supervise the rendered texture \\( \\mathcal{V}_i \\).\n\n   - By progressively refining textures view-by-view using cross-view attention (sharing features across views) and weighted denoising guided by incident angles, the model achieves consistent and high-quality textures across all perspectives.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe cross-view attention mechanism ([mask1]) achieves view-consistent texture refinement by leveraging the incident-angle-weighted denoising (IAW-DE) strategy ([mask2]). Specifically, for each view, IAW-DE computes a weight map based on the cosine similarity between surface normals and viewing directions to identify regions best observed. It then applies more noise and more denoising steps in these well-observed regions, producing a refined texture image. The cross-view attention mechanism incorporates latent features from multiple views—canonical and previous—to ensure the consistency of texture style across views during denoising. By combining these two techniques, the refinement stage progressively enhances texture quality in confident regions while maintaining style consistency across different camera views, resulting in visually coherent and refined textures on the avatar from all perspectives."

As a result, some points, particularly outliers, may not be accurately optimized because the shared parameters cannot specialize representations or predictions per stage. This necessitates the introduction of additional constraints to improve learning and surface accuracy.\n\n# Final Answer:\n\nUsing shared LSNN parameters across multiple MSP stages limits the network’s ability to specialize predictions at different scales, making simultaneous optimization challenging due to inconsistent gradient directions and multi-scale features. This can lead to some outlier query points not being effectively optimized and reduces the accuracy of the predicted signed distance fields at finer details unless additional constraints are applied to guide learning."

This weak or ambiguous semantic correspondence makes adversarial alignment difficult since the domain classifier tries to unify embeddings that may fundamentally differ in information content.\n\n2. **Limited Labeled EEG-Text Pairs**  \n   Unlike vision-language models trained with abundant image-text pairs, EEG-text pairs are scarce and of limited quality. This scarcity undermines training effectiveness and the degree to which domain adversarial training can force meaningful alignment.\n\n3. **Embedding Space Misalignment Risks**  \n   Adversarial training aims for embedding distributions to align generally, but this might lead to oversimplification or loss of vital EEG-specific information. The model might confuse domain invariant features with truly meaningful cross-modal semantics.\n\n4. **Training Stability and Convergence**  \n   Gradient reversal and adversarial training processes are known to sometimes cause unstable training dynamics, requiring careful tuning of the scaling factor and scheduling, which could be challenging given the complex nature of EEG data.\n\n5. **Embedding Space Alignment vs. Embedding-wise Alignment**  \n   The method aligns entire embedding spaces rather than embedding-to-embedding pairs, leading to potentially looser semantics alignment, affecting downstream task performance.\n\nStep 4: Summarize the answer accordingly.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe potential limitations of adversarial **Domain Classifier** training within the **EEG-Text Embedding Space Alignment** include challenges caused by the complexity and ambiguity of EEG signals that are difficult to precisely describe in natural language, leading to weak semantic correspondence. The scarcity of high-quality EEG-text paired data further limits effective adversarial alignment. Moreover, adversarial training may cause embedding space misalignment or loss of important EEG-specific information by focusing on making embeddings indistinguishable at a domain level rather than ensuring semantic consistency. Additionally, training stability issues related to gradient reversal and careful tuning requirements may hinder convergence. Lastly, aligning embedding spaces rather than individual embeddings may result in only coarse alignment, affecting downstream model performance."

Identify what [mask1] refers to in the image and text context:  \n   - The red box highlights the \"Adversarial Image,\" which consists of natural images combined with adversarial perturbations (noise).  \n   - In the figure, this is shown only on the Student side, not the Teacher side.  \n\n2. Understand the purpose of generating adversarial images in the context of the method described:  \n   - The student model receives adversarial images as input to improve its robustness.  \n   - The teacher model only receives natural images (clean images) to maintain high accuracy and produce reliable soft labels.  \n\n3. Textual explanation from the \"Inner Maximization\" and \"Outer Minimization\" sections:  \n   - APD focuses on visual vulnerabilities by generating adversarial examples only on the image modality.  \n   - The adversarial images are generated \"on the fly\" to maximize dissimilarity between the student's image representation and the ground truth text representation.  \n   - This adversarial example generation helps the student learn robust prompts by minimizing KL divergence to the teacher’s soft labels.  \n   - The teacher remains trained on clean data to ensure stable, high-quality soft labels that guide the student.  \n\n4. Motivation for generating adversarial examples only for the student image encoder with visual prompts:  \n   - To provide the student model with challenging (adversarial) inputs so it learns robust visual representations.  \n   - The teacher serves as a stable reference trained on clean images; it does not encounter adversarial images, maintaining clean signal accuracy.  \n   - Focusing adversarial perturbations on the student's image modality leverages the known visual vulnerability of CLIP without complicating the text input.  \n   - This targeted adversarial training improves the student's robustness while preserving alignment with the teacher’s generalization ability.  \n\n**Final answer:**\n\nThe motivation for generating adversarial images only for the student image encoder with visual prompts is to expose the student model to challenging, adversarially perturbed visual inputs that help it learn robust visual representations. Meanwhile, the teacher model, trained only on clean images, provides stable and reliable soft labels. This strategy allows the student to improve its adversarial robustness while maintaining alignment with the teacher’s generalization ability, thereby achieving a better balance between natural accuracy and adversarial robustness."

There is a red dashed arrow labeled \"Generate AE\" (AE = adversarial example) pointing from the \"Logits\" output back to the \"Adversarial Image + Noise\" input. This indicates that the adversarial image is generated by perturbing the original image guided by the student's logits.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand what is inside the red box [mask1]\n\n- The student model takes an adversarial image as input.\n- The adversarial image is created by adding perturbation (noise) to the clean natural image.\n- Visual and textual prompts for the student are trainable parameters.\n- The image encoder and text encoder within the student model are frozen.\n- The student produces \"logits\", which represent similarity scores between the image and text representations.\n- This output is then used for subsequent loss calculations and feedback.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: What is the goal regarding adversarial sample generation?\n\nFrom the context's \"**Inner Maximization**\" section:\n\n- The adversarial samples are generated \"on the fly\" during training for the student model.\n- Only visual perturbations (adversarial images) are produced.\n- The perturbed image should maximize the dissimilarity (maximize the cross-entropy loss) between the student model's output logits and the ground truth text prompt representation.\n\nFormally, it is described as maximizing the cross-entropy loss on the student logits to generate an adversarial example:\n\n\\[\nx' = \\arg \\max_{x' , \\|x' - x\\| \\leq \\epsilon} \\mathcal{L}_{CE} (S(x'), y)\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(x\\) = original image,\n- \\(x'\\) = adversarial image,\n- \\(S(x')\\) = student model's logits for the adversarial image,\n- \\(y\\) = ground truth label,\n- \\(\\epsilon\\) = perturbation budget constraint.\n\nThis is a typical adversarial attack formulation: perturb input image within norm constraint \\(\\epsilon\\) to increase loss (fool the model).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: How is this reflected in the diagram?\n\n- The green forward arrows show original image + perturbation combined to form adversarial image input to the student image encoder.\n- The red dashed line (\"Generate AE\") goes backward from the student's logits to create/adapt the perturbation.\n- This implies an iterative adversarial attack (e.g., PGD or similar), where gradients of the loss with respect to input image pixels are calculated based on the student's cross-entropy loss.\n- Using this gradient, the input image is perturbed such that the student's cross-entropy loss is maximized.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary / Final Answer:**\n\nThe adversarial sample is generated by adding a constrained perturbation to the natural input image such that the **student model's cross-entropy loss is maximized**. Practically, this is done by computing the gradient of the cross-entropy loss (between student logits and the true label) with respect to the input image, and iteratively perturbing the image in the direction that increases this loss while keeping the perturbation within a norm bound ([epsilon]). This process corresponds to the inner maximization step in Adversarial Prompt Distillation (APD) and is visualized by the red dashed arrow in the student block of the diagram.\n\n---\n\n**Therefore, the adversarial sample is generated by maximizing the cross-entropy loss of the student model through gradient-based perturbation of the input image under a given perturbation budget.**"

This recovers historical knowledge and prevents cumulative errors/instability.\n\n3. **Adaptive, decaying momentum for EMA update**  \n   Unlike fixed momentum \\(m\\), the AMU strategy **adapts the momentum \\(m_t\\) over time (decays)** with each incoming sample:\n\n\\[\nm_t = \\max(m_0 \\gamma^{t}, \\bar{m})\n\\]\n\nwhere  \n- \\(m_0\\) is initial momentum  \n- \\(\\gamma < 1\\) is decay factor  \n- \\(\\bar{m}\\) is minimum momentum threshold  \n\nThis means that as adaptation proceeds, the momentum for updating the teacher model decreases, giving **less weight to later samples** and helping prevent forgetting of the original source knowledge.\n\n4. **Motivation and benefit**  \n- Fixed momentum can cause forgetting in long-term TTA (test-time adaptation).  \n- Decaying momentum balances historical knowledge retention and fast adaptation.  \n- Resets and adaptive EMA together **reduce error accumulation** and **improve stability** in online TTA.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Final summary answer\n\nThe [mask1] module (AMU) adapts the classic EMA update strategy in teacher-student networks by:\n\n- Using the teacher model as a **historical knowledge buffer**, not directly for prediction.\n- **Resetting the student model to the teacher model parameters at each test step** before adapting online to the current sample, preventing drift and error accumulation.\n- Employing an **adaptive, decaying EMA momentum** that decreases with each new sample to reduce the impact of later samples on the teacher weights, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting during long-term adaptation.\n- This alternating momentum update ensures stable, balanced knowledge retention and quick test-time adaptation in an online setting.\n\n---\n\n# **Answer:**\n\nThe [mask1] module adapts the EMA update strategy from teacher-student networks by retaining the teacher model as a buffer of historical knowledge and resetting the student model parameters to the teacher model before adapting to each new test sample. It further modifies the classic fixed EMA momentum by introducing a decaying momentum schedule that gradually reduces the influence of new samples during teacher updates. This strategy helps avoid the forgetting of source knowledge and error accumulation during long-term online test-time adaptation, providing a stable and effective adaptation process."

It is designed to adaptively generate an input-dependent prompt for each test sample, unlike previous methods that use fixed prompts for all samples.\n\n2. **Why a dynamic prompt?**  \n   The text explains that fixed prompts ignore data variety within the target domain, which can limit adaptation. To handle diverse styles in test data, a dynamic prompt conditioned on the input itself is essential to adapt the model effectively to each distinct test image.\n\n3. **How is the dynamic prompt generated?**  \n   - The Input Decorator (ID) is parameterized by some parameters \\(\\omega_{ID}\\) and takes the normalized input test sample \\(\\hat{x}^t\\) as input.  \n   - It uses two shallow convolutional layers combined with an Instance Normalization (IN) layer and a ReLU activation layer, as illustrated inside the red box in the figure.  \n   - Instance Normalization is known for its effectiveness in style transfer and helps align the style distribution of the target data closer to that of the source.\n\n4. **Mathematical formulation (from text):**   \n   The reformulated test input \\(\\tilde{x}^t\\) is computed as:\n   \\[\n   \\tilde{x}^t = \\hat{x}^t + ID(\\hat{x}^t)\n   \\]\n   This means the dynamic prompt generated by the ID module is added to the input test image after normalization, effectively shifting its style.\n\n5. **Impact on style shift adaptation:**  \n   By conditioning the prompt on each input image, the ID adaptively modifies the test input's style distribution towards the source domain. This helps reduce low-level style discrepancy between the source and target without retraining or complex domain-specific transformations. The dynamic nature ensures the model can handle diverse and varying style shifts in the target domain efficiently.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe Input Decorator (ID) module dynamically formulates a style-adaptive prompt conditioned on each test input by applying two shallow convolutional layers with Instance Normalization and ReLU, which generates an input-dependent residual added to the normalized test image. This dynamic prompt adaptively shifts the test sample’s style distribution closer to the source domain style at the pixel level, thereby effectively reducing the low-level style shift for diverse test samples during test-time adaptation."

This reset prevents error accumulation from sequential online updates on individual samples. The student model quickly adapts to each incoming sample while the teacher model preserves long-term knowledge. Additionally, the EMA momentum decays over time, reducing the impact of noisy later samples and avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Together, this alternating updating scheme ensures stable and effective adaptation during online test-time training."

This implies a mostly feedforward, local, fixed architecture without explicit modeling of long-range dependencies or contextual relationships between points.\n\n2. **What does an attention mechanism bring?**  \n   - Attention enables the network to model **relationships between all points** in the point cloud, allowing each point's deformation to be predicted considering **global context**.  \n   - Non-rigid deformations are often complex and spatially correlated, where the displacement of a point depends on other points, possibly distant ones.  \n   - Attention mechanisms can dynamically weight influence among points, capturing more expressive and adaptive spatial dependencies.\n   - This leads to **better feature aggregation** and **context-aware predictions**.\n\n3. **Why would this improve the deformation matrix predictions?**  \n   - The deformation matrix encodes how each point moves to match the target shape.  \n   - Capturing **complex non-rigid transformations** requires understanding not only local geometry but relationships across the entire structure.  \n   - Attention mechanisms can let the model learn such relationships better than static feedforward layers.  \n   - Improved contextual modeling reduces overfitting to training distributions and helps generalize to unseen shapes and subtle transformations, especially under few-shot conditions highlighted in the study.\n\n4. **Supporting context from the paper:**  \n   - The paper emphasizes the complexity of non-rigid patterns and the need for models to generalize under few-shot and high-noise scenarios.  \n   - Existing works like RoITr and Lepard have introduced attention for encoding correspondences and achieved better results but still encounter limitations.  \n   - The authors use MLPs and FC layers likely for efficiency and simplicity, but attention could enhance feature learning for deformation prediction.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\nReplacing the **decoder composed of fully connected layers** ([mask1]) with an **attention mechanism** would allow the model to capture global contextual relationships between points more effectively during the prediction of the deformation matrix ([mask2]). By leveraging attention, the network can adaptively weigh the influence of other points when estimating each point's displacement, leading to more accurate and coherent deformation predictions. This improved modeling of spatial dependencies can especially enhance performance in complex non-rigid registration tasks under few-shot scenarios, resulting in more precise alignment and better generalization to unseen transformation patterns."

These features may encode sensitive data that an adversary or the fusion server could exploit to reconstruct private information about the inputs, thus posing privacy risks despite the distributed nature of model deployment on edge devices.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nAggregating sub-model features using the Fusion MLP introduces potential privacy trade-offs such as exposure of sensitive information contained within intermediate feature representations.

This red box encloses two submodules:  \n- Model Splitting (Class Assignment and Weight Selection to get sub-models and Fusion MLP)  \n- Model Pruning (Weight Pruning → Retraining → Metric Trade-off)  \n- Fusion & Inference (fuse outputs of sub-models for final decision)  \n\nThe question asks what challenges arise when Model Assignment faces highly heterogeneous edge device memory and compute capacities.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **From the image and the text**, Model Assignment involves allocating sub-models (pruned and split Vision Transformer sub-models) to edge devices based on resource constraints (memory and compute).\n\n2. **From the Problem Formulation (Section 3):**  \n- Multiple edge devices have highly varying memory (`M_i`) and computational resources (`E_i`).  \n- Each sub-model requires a certain memory size and FLOPs (energy) to run.  \n- The assignment problem is to allocate sub-models to edge devices such that memory and computational requirements are satisfied, inference latency is minimized, and accuracy (from fused results) is above a threshold.  \n- This is formalized as combinatorial optimization, akin to a \"0-1 knapsack\" problem with heterogeneous constraints.\n\n3. **From the Methodology (Section 4.4, Model Assignment):**  \n- The greedy search algorithm assigns the most computation-intensive sub-models first, to devices with the highest remaining memory and compute power.  \n- If a sub-model cannot fit in any device due to insufficient memory or energy capacity, the algorithm prunes the sub-model further and retries assignment.  \n- If no assignment is feasible, it indicates a failure that triggers re-pruning of sub-models to reduce their resource demands.\n\n4. **Challenges highlighted** include:  \n- **Heterogeneous devices with different and limited memory and compute resources** create difficulty in finding feasible assignments for all sub-models.  \n- Some devices may run out of memory or computational capacity (\"memory-exhausted device is removed from the set\").  \n- It may require iterative pruning and reallocation to fit sub-models within constraints, which can lead to tradeoffs between model complexity (accuracy) and resource usage.  \n- Achieving balanced workload distribution is complicated due to varying sub-model sizes and device resources.  \n- Ensuring that, despite pruning, accuracy remains satisfactory while meeting latency and resource constraints is non-trivial.\n\n5. **Therefore, the main challenges when Model Assignment faces highly heterogeneous edge device memory and compute capacities are:**  \n- Difficulty in fitting sub-models into limited memory and compute budgets of various heterogeneous devices.  \n- Need for iterative pruning and re-assignment to meet constraints, complicating the deployment process.  \n- Potential degradation in model accuracy due to pruning required to fit sub-models into resource-constrained devices.  \n- Complexity in balancing workloads among devices to minimize maximal inference latency under resource heterogeneity.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n**When the Model Assignment faces highly heterogeneous edge device memory and compute capacities, it encounters the challenge of fitting sub-models with varying memory and computational demands onto devices with diverse and limited resources. This may lead to situations where some sub-models cannot be assigned because they exceed device memory or energy constraints. Consequently, the framework must iteratively prune and reassign sub-models to find a feasible deployment plan. This iterative process introduces a trade-off between maintaining model accuracy and adhering to resource limitations. Additionally, balancing the workload across heterogeneous devices to minimize inference latency becomes complex, making optimal assignment challenging.**"

Model Splitting  \n  2. Model Pruning  \n  3. Model Assignment  \n  4. Model Fusion & Inference  \n\n- Within the \"Model Splitting\" step, there are two internal stages shown: \"Class Assignment\" followed immediately by \"Weight Selection\" (highlighted with a red box in the diagram).\n\n- The textual description in Section 4.2 (Model Splitting) clarifies the process:  \n  - The original Vision Transformer (ViT) is decomposed into several smaller sub-models, each responsible for detecting a specific subset of classes (\"Class Assignment\").  \n  - However, keeping all connections (e.g., attention heads) for each class can be redundant. Thus, after assigning classes to sub-models, they prune connections (heads) selectively (\"Weight Selection\") to reduce computation for each sub-model based on the assigned classes.  \n  - The number of heads retained impacts the model size and complexity; more heads mean more connections and higher complexity.\n\n- The rationale behind this ordering is explained in multiple sections:  \n  - Class assignment divides tasks by specific sets of classes to sub-models.  \n  - Immediately after, weight selection (pruning the attention heads) is performed to remove redundant parts irrelevant for the assigned classes, improving efficiency and resource usage.  \n  - This step is essential before model assignment to edge devices, as pruning reduces memory and computational requirements, enabling efficient deployment on resource-limited devices.  \n\n- From Section 4.1 and 4.2, the motivation is clear: **class assignment first decides which classes each sub-model handles, and weight selection refines each sub-model by pruning unnecessary weights based on those specific classes.**\n\n- This also allows subsequent steps — pruning, assignment, and fusion — to be more effective, because pruning is tailored to the actual class subsets each sub-model handles.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n**The reason for ordering \"Weight Selection\" (i.e., pruning) immediately after \"Class Assignment\" is to prune unnecessary weights or attention heads specific to the subset of classes assigned to each sub-model. This selective pruning removes redundant connections that are irrelevant for the assigned classes, thus reducing the computational and memory complexity of each sub-model. Performing weight selection after class assignment ensures that pruning is class-specific and tailored to optimize each sub-model’s size and efficiency before deployment on resource-constrained edge devices.**"

This is denoted \\(y_w^*\\) and \\(y_l^*\\).\n   - The **Gap** arises because the actual data distribution is \\(y_w\\), \\(y_l\\), which differs from the optimal \\(y_w^*\\), \\(y_l^*\\).\n\n2. **Importance Sampling Concept**\n\n   - Since sampling directly from the optimal distributions \\(y_w^*\\) and \\(y_l^*\\) is infeasible, TIS-DPO proposes to use **importance sampling** with the actual data distribution \\(y_w\\).\n   - Importance sampling reweights samples obtained from the known distribution \\(y_w\\) to estimate expectations with respect to the unknown target distribution \\(y_w^*\\).\n\n3. **What is Sampling \\(y_w^*\\)?**\n\n   - Sampling \\(y_w^*\\) represents the optimal distribution where token-level expected rewards are equalized; it is the ideal sampling of tokens that would maximize the desired property (unbiasedness, improved optimization efficiency).\n   - However, as \\(y_w^*\\) (optimal distribution) is not available, the figure shows **importance sampling** performed from \\(y_w\\).\n\n4. **Combining Sampling \\(y_w^*\\) with Importance Sampling \\(y_w\\)**\n\n   - The key is to use samples from \\(y_w\\) but weight them to mimic sampling from \\(y_w^*\\).\n   - This is done by assigning **importance weights** based on the ratio of probabilities or token rewards so that weighted samples from \\(y_w\\) approximate the distribution of \\(y_w^*\\).\n   - In the figure, \"Sampling \\(y_w^*\\)\" and \"Importance Sampling \\(y_w\\)\" are connected by a double arrow, indicating that sampling from the optimal distribution is equivalent to importance sampling from the real distribution with appropriate weights.\n\n5. **Result**\n\n   - Applying these importance weights to the samples from \\(y_w\\) produces **weighted token distributions \\(Y_w\\), \\(Y_l\\)**, where each token's contribution is adjusted by its importance weight corresponding to its reward.\n   - This leads to an unbiased estimate of the ideal token-level reward distribution, enabling the **TIS-DPO objective** that uses weighted response sequences and weighted token sequences.\n   - Consequently, when maximizing likelihood with the weighted distributions, the resulting learned model corresponds to the **unbiased final LLM** from the optimal distribution.\n\n---\n\n### Summarized answer:\n\nThe **sampling \\(y_w^*\\)** (optimal winning token distribution) cannot be performed directly, so TIS-DPO equivalently uses **importance sampling with the real winning data distribution \\(y_w\\)**. By importance sampling \\(y_w\\), each token in the real data is assigned an importance weight proportional to its estimated reward (the ratio between the optimal and real distributions). Multiplying the sampled tokens \\(y_w\\) by these weights produces weighted token distributions \\(Y_w\\) and \\(Y_l\\). These weighted distributions effectively approximate sampling from the optimal \\(y_w^*\\) and enable a token-level optimized training objective that leads to an unbiased final LLM.\n\n---\n\n### Final concise answer:\n\nSampling \\(y_w^*\\) (the optimal token distribution) is impractical, so TIS-DPO performs importance sampling on the actual data distribution \\(y_w\\), weighting each token by its importance weight derived from estimated token rewards. This process adjusts the real token samples to create weighted token distributions that approximate the optimal \\(y_w^*\\). Thus, the weighted \\(Y_w\\) and \\(Y_l\\) represent importance-sampled versions of the optimal token distributions, enabling unbiased and efficient token-level optimization in the final LLM."

This makes optimization unbiased with respect to the ideal dataset distribution, where tokens of winning and losing sequences have consistent expected rewards.\n\n- Mathematically, this means that during maximum likelihood optimization, the sequences used (winning and losing responses) are **weighted token-wise** rather than treated uniformly.\n\nSpecifically, the **TIS-DPO objective** (the red box) involves:\n\n- Taking the original data sequences \\(y_w\\) and \\(y_l\\),\n- Weighting each token in these sequences by importance weights (proportional to estimated token rewards),\n- Then maximizing a weighted log-likelihood objective (maximum likelihood),\n\nwhere\n\n- The **weighted losing response tokens (weighted \\(y_l\\))** (blue box) represent the contribution of the losing sequences to the loss function but scaled according to token weights.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: How does the red box incorporate the blue box during maximum likelihood optimization?\n\n- The **TIS-DPO objective (red box)** modifies the original DPO maximum likelihood objective by replacing the uniform token distributions \\(y_w, y_l\\) with their weighted counterparts.\n\n- The **weighted losing token distribution (blue box)** is an essential component of the red box, representing the weighted tokens of the losing response.\n\n- To incorporate this into maximum likelihood optimization, each token's log-likelihood contribution from the losing response is multiplied by an importance weight corresponding to that token.\n\n- Hence, the model is trained to decrease the probability of losing tokens proportionally more if those tokens have higher importance weights (low reward tokens are assigned lower weights), reducing noise.\n\n- This weighted treatment leads to a **weighted sequence KL divergence** objective where the losing sequence tokens are weighted differently, reflecting their token-level importance.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Summarize the chain-of-thought to the final answer\n\n- TIS-DPO objective (red box) applies **token-level importance weights** to both winning and losing responses.\n\n- The blue box (Weighted \\(y_l\\)) specifically assigns weights to tokens in the losing sequences.\n\n- These weights modify the impact of tokens during maximum likelihood optimization by scaling their log probabilities in the negative direction (losing tokens are downweighted or upweighted in loss).\n\n- This allows the training objective to focus more on important tokens, improving optimization efficiency and stability.\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer:\n\nThe **TIS-DPO objective (red box)** incorporates the **weighted losing token distribution (blue box)** by assigning token-level importance weights to the tokens of the losing response during maximum likelihood optimization. Specifically, during training, each token in the losing sequence \\(y_l\\) is multiplied by its corresponding importance weight (estimated from token rewards), thereby weighting its contribution to the loss function. This results in a weighted maximum likelihood objective where the negative impact of losing tokens on the model’s parameters is scaled according to their importance, enabling more efficient and unbiased optimization compared to treating all tokens uniformly."

This token-level importance sampling adjusts the token contributions before applying maximum likelihood optimization, thus correcting the token-level biases inherent in DPO’s original bandit formulation that treats all tokens equally. By doing so, TIS-DPO achieves unbiased training aligned with the optimal token reward distribution, reducing noise and improving alignment efficiency."

This implies **all tokens are treated equally**, regardless of their individual reward contribution.\n\n- The **Desired DPO Token Reward Distribution** shows the ideal scenario, where tokens in winning (\\(y_w^*\\)) and losing (\\(y_l^*\\)) sequences all have equal expected rewards token-wise (optimal token-level data distribution).\n\n- The **Gap** in the figure highlights that the current DPO’s uniform token treatment leads to noise and reduced optimization efficiency because real data tokens have varying rewards, even inside winning responses.\n\n- The **Solution** section introduces Importance Sampling with the **Current Distribution** to approximate the **Optimal/Desired Data Distribution**, by weighting tokens to reflect their actual importance or reward.\n\n- Specifically, the **red box** ([mask1]) shows the **Weighted \\(y_w\\)** — winning tokens weighted by importance sampling weights based on their estimated rewards.\n\n- The **blue box** ([mask2]) shows the **Weighted \\(y_l\\)** — losing tokens weighted similarly.\n\n- Both weighted sequences are input into a **TIS-DPO Objective** with maximum likelihood optimization, yielding an unbiased, improved final LLM that essentially bridges the gap.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: From the text, what is the effect of weighting tokens?\n\n- Traditional DPO assigns **equal weight** to each token.\n\n- The weighting (importance sampling) introduced by TIS-DPO assigns **importance weights proportional to token reward estimates** to each token in the winning and losing sequences.\n\n- This leads to adjusting gradient estimates in two ways:\n\n  1. **Magnitude Adjustment**: Tokens with higher estimated reward receive higher weights, thus gradients corresponding to these tokens are amplified; tokens with lower reward have lower weights, reducing their influence.\n\n  2. **Noise Reduction**: By acknowledging token heterogeneity, TIS-DPO reduces noise from uniformly treating low-importance tokens as equally important, improving signal-to-noise ratio and optimization efficiency.\n\n- As per Eq. 18 and surrounding explanation, the **importance weights multiply the KL divergence and the likelihood terms**, changing the gradient contributions from different tokens.\n\n- The weighted tokens thus provide an **unbiased estimation of gradients relative to the optimal data distribution**, whereas DPO’s uniform token weighting introduces bias and noise.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: What does the \"bandit-based reward distribution\" in DPO refer to?\n\n- DPO is described as being based on a sequence-level Bradley-Terry bandit model where rewards are modeled at the full sequence level (win/loss), ignoring token-level granularity.\n\n- This approach treats all tokens equally, uniformly increasing likelihood of the \"winning\" sequence tokens and decreasing the \"losing\" sequence tokens, regardless of token importance.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Bringing it all together\n\n- **Weighted \\(y_w\\) and Weighted \\(y_l\\)** adjust the gradient estimates by applying token-level importance weights derived from token reward estimates, rather than equal weighting.\n\n- This modifies the gradient updates such that tokens contributing more to the reward have proportionally larger gradient influence, and vice versa.\n\n- Compared to DPO’s bandit-based approach (uniform token weighting), this results in **more accurate, less noisy gradient estimates** that better reflect actual token importance, leading to **more efficient and unbiased optimization**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final answer:**\n\n[mask1] and [mask2], the weighted winning and losing token distributions respectively, adjust gradient estimates by applying token-level importance weights proportional to each token’s estimated reward. Unlike DPO’s bandit-based reward distribution that treats all tokens uniformly, these weighted sequences assign greater gradient influence to higher-reward tokens and less to lower-reward ones. This weighted approach reduces noise from uniformly treating all tokens equally, resulting in unbiased and more efficient gradient estimates that better capture token importance during optimization. Consequently, the gradients derived from [mask1] and [mask2] reflect a token-level importance sampling correction to the traditional DPO objective, improving learning stability and effectiveness.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- DPO: Uniform token weighting → noisy gradients, inefficient optimization  \n- TIS-DPO ([mask1] & [mask2]): Weighted tokens with importance sampling → weighted gradients that prioritize crucial tokens → unbiased, stable, and efficient optimization."

The highest-level arrow shows red arrows labeled as “Interaction-level” dependencies.\n  - The red box encloses multiple interactions, behavior-item pairs, and shows arrows between interactions with different item and behavior types.\n\n- The **blue box** in the image corresponds to **behavior-level and item-level dependencies.**\n\n  Evidence:\n\n  - The blue box encloses two smaller boxes — red and dark cyan — that each correspond roughly to behavior-level and item-level dependencies indicated by arrows.\n\n  \nThus:\n\n- **[mask1] = interaction-level dependencies**\n\n- **[mask2] = behavior-level and item-level dependencies**\n\nOr more simply, [mask2] = finer-grained dependency learning modeled by attention-only methods focusing on behavior-level or item-level dependencies, but **not integrated interaction-level dependencies.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Understand the contrast between attention-only methods and integrated modeling\n\nFrom the context (Introduction, CH1):\n\n- Previous methods (MB-GMN, MB-GCN, DMT) model multi-behavior dependencies at:\n\n  - Behavior-level dependency (interactions with the same behavior type).\n\n  - Item-level dependency (interactions with the same item).\n\n- MB-STR models item-level multi-behavior dependency via multi-head self-attention.\n\n- **However, multi-behavior dependency between interactions with inconsistent behavior types AND items, defined as interaction-level dependency, is rarely modeled.**\n\n- This interaction-level dependency is important because different types of user interactions on different items can influence each other.\n\nExample:\n\n- Purchasing a cellphone increases the probability of clicking on an earphone (different item and behavior types).\n\n  \nThus, **modeling interaction-level dependencies integrates item-level and behavior-level semantics simultaneously**, capturing more complex heterogeneous dependencies between user interactions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: What the paper proposes:\n\n- The **interaction-level dependency extractor** models multi-behavior dependencies at the interaction level by integrating item-level and behavior-level dependencies synchronously.\n\n- It constructs an **interaction-aware graph**, whose incidence matrix encodes the inner product of item-level and behavior-level dependency representations, enabling integrated dependency modeling.\n\n- Graph convolution is performed on this graph to capture low-order to high-order interaction-level dependencies effectively.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: How does this improve dependency learning compared to attention-only methods?\n\n- Attention-only methods model dependencies asynchronously or independently (either behavior-level or item-level), ignoring the cross-dependency between item and behavior types.\n\n- Integrated modeling learns dependencies **in a synchronous and holistic manner at the interaction level**, capturing complex semantic relations between heterogeneous interaction types.\n\n- This integrated modeling captures relationships that span **different behaviors and different items simultaneously**, which attention-only methods cannot model effectively.\n\n- Graph convolution on an interaction graph further models high-order dependencies beyond immediate neighbors, something attention-only layers on sequential data cannot robustly capture.\n\n---\n\n### Final formulation of the answer\n\n**Integrated modeling of interaction-level and item-level dependencies enhances behavior-level dependency learning over attention-only methods by:**\n\n- **Synchronously capturing item-specific and behavior-specific semantic information at the interaction level through an interaction-aware graph structure**, rather than treating item and behavior dependencies independently.\n\n- **Modeling multi-behavior dependencies across heterogeneous interaction types, enabling richer and more complex cross-behavior and cross-item relationship learning.**\n\n- **Utilizing graph convolution to iteratively learn both low-order and high-order interaction-level dependencies, improving the representation of personalized behavior patterns beyond the capacity of attention-only methods which generally model either item- or behavior-level dependencies in isolation.**\n\n---\n\n# **Final answer:**\n\nIntegrated modeling of **interaction-level dependencies** ([mask1], red box) and item-level dependencies enhances **behavior-level dependency** ([mask2], blue box) learning by synchronously encoding both item-specific and behavior-specific semantics within a unified interaction-aware graph. This approach captures complex multi-behavior dependencies across heterogeneous interactions that attention-only methods, which model item- or behavior-level dependencies independently, fail to capture. Moreover, iterative graph convolution exploits the high-order dependencies at the interaction level, further improving personalized behavior pattern modeling beyond what attention mechanisms alone can achieve."

By modeling these dependencies through graph convolution and integrating them into the multifaceted sequential pattern generator, the model can accurately form coarse-grained (granularity2) user preferences across diverse sessions, such as grouping related item-level preferences (granularity1) into broader categories like \"Electronic\" and \"Sports.\" Thus, [mask1] enables the synthesis of complex, multi-grained user preferences by encoding rich, integrated behavioral signals essential for granularity2 preference formation."

Multifaceted Sequential Pattern Generator:**  \n- User preferences are multi-grained and vary in different time scales.  \n- Interaction sequences are divided into **sessions** to capture preferences at different time granularities.  \n- \"Multi-grained multi-head self-attention layer\" is proposed to encode multi-grained preferences within these sessions.  \n- Different grouping lengths of items within a session generate **multi-grained user queries** (reflecting varying priority and local invariance).  \n- These multi-grained queries then participate in multi-head self-attention to extract hierarchical, nuanced short-term preferences.  \n- This multifaceted approach complements the global (long-term) sequential pattern captured via linear self-attention.  \n- The outputs are fused to enrich the representation of sequential user preferences across sessions.\n\nStep 4: Summarize how the **behavior-aware multi-grained preference extraction** enriches sequential pattern encoding across sessions.\n\n- By dividing interaction sequences into sessions across multiple time scales, the model captures user preferences that change over time.  \n- Within each session, grouping recent items at different granularities generates multi-grained queries that reflect finer or coarser user intents.  \n- Multi-head self-attention over these multi-grained queries captures complex short-term preferences and inherent priority within the session.  \n- This session-level multi-grained modeling enriches the simple sequential pattern by adding layered, behavior-aware context and dynamic preference shifts.  \n- Finally, fusing multi-grained short-term preferences with global long-term preferences leads to a comprehensive encoding of sequential patterns across sessions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe behavior-aware multi-grained preference extraction (highlighted by the red box) enriches sequential pattern encoding across sessions by dividing user interaction sequences into sessions over multiple time scales and generating multi-grained queries that capture user preferences at various granularities within each session. This allows the model to represent complex and dynamic short-term preferences via a multi-head self-attention mechanism that encodes inherent priority and local patterns inside sessions.

AdaIN refers to Adaptive Instance Normalization features, which are used for style transfer by adjusting feature statistics.  \n   - The blue box ([mask2]) highlights the \"Noise Predictor\" component named \"TransDiffuser,\" which predicts noise in the discrete diffusion process conditioned on AdaIN features.\n\n2. **Understanding the flow and usage of features:**  \n   - AdaIN features ([mask1]) are extracted from CNN encoders that take the content and style images as input and are used to condition the noise predictor (TransDiffuser) ([mask2]).  \n   - This conditioning helps guide the diffusion process to incorporate style features into the content image during the generation.\n\n3. **Potential bias issue when using AdaIN features in TransDiffuser conditioning:**  \n   - The question asks about **potential bias arising from using AdaIN features in the noise predictor conditioning**.  \n   - Normally, applying AdaIN features might introduce a strong stylistic bias toward the style image that could override or distort the content features, resulting in over-stylization or decreased content fidelity.  \n   - However, the context explicitly states:  \n     “This allows transferring features from the style image to the content image **without bias**,”  \n     implying that the proposed approach carefully employs AdaIN to avoid such bias.  \n\n4. **From the context and diagram:**  \n   - Problems the method solves include **over-stylization**, **under-stylization**, and **mode collapse**, implying that a naive use of AdaIN features in conditioning can lead to bias such as over-stylization (too much style over content) or mode collapse (lack of diversity in outputs).  \n   - Therefore, the potential bias in using AdaIN features in the noise predictor conditioning traditionally would be **bias towards the style features that can diminish or distort content semantics**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe potential bias arises from using **AdaIN features (style features)** in the **noise predictor (TransDiffuser) conditioning** is that it may introduce a **stylistic bias towards the style image**, which can lead to **over-stylization** and cause the generated image to lose fidelity or semantic accuracy to the original content image.

Cultural Appropriation and Insensitivity:  \n- The latent space quantizer encodes styles that may represent specific cultural, ethnic, or traditional art forms.  \n- Using these styles without proper context or attribution risks cultural appropriation, where cultural heritage is exploited or used disrespectfully inappropriately.  \n- Stylization could simplify or distort significant cultural symbols, leading to misrepresentation or trivialization of cultural art.\n\n2. Bias and Misrepresentation in Training Data:  \n- The quantizer and overall model are trained on datasets like WikiArt, which may have imbalanced representation favoring certain cultures or art styles over others.  \n- This imbalance could lead to the exclusion or poor representation of minority cultural art styles, reinforcing cultural biases in artistic style generation.\n\n3. Identity and Ownership Concerns:  \n- Artistic styles are often part of cultural identity; automatic style transfer via quantized latent spaces may violate artists' rights or community ownership if commercialized without consent.  \n- The discrete quantized styles might enable replication of unique indigenous or traditional art patterns without permission.\n\n4. Loss of Context and Meaning:  \n- Quantization and discrete representation simplify styles into codebook tokens, which might erase the nuanced meaning or historical contexts behind cultural styles.  \n- The stylized outputs may lack acknowledgment of cultural significance, potentially offending communities or diminishing cultural value.\n\n5. Ethical Use in Downstream Applications:  \n- Using quantized style representations to produce commercial or popular content could commodify cultural expressions.  \n- Without ethical guidelines or controls, this may contribute to exploitation or erasure of cultural heritage.\n\nStep 4: Summarized answer  \nThe use of latent space quantization via the VQ-GAN encoder’s quantizer in style transfer models involving diverse cultural styles raises ethical concerns related to cultural appropriation, misrepresentation, and bias due to imbalanced training data. Quantizing diverse cultural artistic styles risks trivializing or distorting culturally significant features, potentially disrespecting the originating communities. Moreover, there are concerns about ownership and consent, as discrete latent codes might enable replicating and commercializing culturally sensitive art without approval. Additionally, simplifying styles into discrete tokens may cause loss of cultural context and meaning, leading to insensitive or inappropriate stylization. Therefore, ethical use requires careful consideration of cultural respect, fairness in data representation, and proper attribution when leveraging quantized latent spaces in style transfer involving diverse cultural styles.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nEthical concerns arising from latent space quantization via the VQ-GAN encoder’s quantizer with diverse cultural styles include the risk of cultural appropriation and insensitivity by misusing or trivializing culturally significant artistic styles without proper attribution or context. The discrete quantization may oversimplify or distort important cultural symbols, leading to misrepresentation. Additionally, biases in training data may cause uneven representation of cultural styles, reinforcing marginalization. There are also concerns around ownership and consent, as the quantized latent codes could facilitate unauthorized reproduction and commercialization of culturally sensitive artworks. Finally, the loss of contextual and historical meaning in the quantized latent space could result in culturally insensitive stylization. These ethical issues necessitate careful, culturally respectful deployment of such style transfer models."

This implies Pearson Correlation may not capture nonlinear or complex dynamics well.\n   - Pearson Correlation only measures linear relationships at the lowest level connectivity.\n   - It does not consider the multi-scale, multi-level attributes of neuronal signals and connectivity, which motivates the use of STFE that extracts features at multiple hierarchical levels.\n\n3. **Impact on STFE outputs and connectome**:  \n   Because traditional Pearson Correlation is limited to linear associations and lowest-level connectivity, using it for connectome construction likely results in a less rich or less representative connectome. This affects the STFE outputs in that the deeper, nonlinear, or hierarchical temporal-spatial functional relationships may not be fully captured or represented in the connectome, limiting the discriminative power of features learned by the subsequent GCN layers.\n\n4. **Summary of limitations (answer to the question)**:  \n   Using Pearson Correlation for connectome construction limits the connectome to capturing only linear, lowest-level inter-regional relationships. This constrains the STFE outputs and the overall network's ability to represent and exploit richer, nonlinear, multi-scale spatio-temporal dependencies in brain connectivity, potentially affecting the model’s classification performance and capacity to reveal complex functional patterns related to Alzheimer's disease.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe limitations of using Pearson Correlation for connectome construction, as highlighted in the red box, are that it captures only linear and lowest-level inter-regional connectivity. This restricts the STFE outputs by failing to represent nonlinear, multi-scale, and hierarchical spatio-temporal relationships in the brain signals, thereby limiting the richness and discriminative capability of the generated functional connectomes used for Alzheimer's disease classification."

        "response": "Let's first identify the [mask1] and [mask2] from the image and the description:\n\n- [mask1] is the content highlighted by a **red box** in the image.\n- [mask2] is the content highlighted by a **blue box** in the image.\n\nFrom the figure caption and the diagram, these correspond to:\n\n- **Red box**: STFE blocks (Spatio-Temporal Feature Extractors)\n- **Blue box**: GCN blocks (Graph Convolutional Networks)\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand what is inside the red box (STFE)\n\nThe red box contains multiple STFE blocks stacked. The STFE module is described as a special design to extract spatio-temporal features from fMRI time series at different hierarchical levels, which contain richer multi-scale information. The STFE module captures temporal and spatial features by the combination of transformer-based spatial feature extraction and linear decomposition-based temporal feature extraction.\n\nThe output of STFE blocks are used to generate multi-level connectomes (graphs), through calculation of Pearson correlation coefficient matrices on the extracted features.\n\n**Therefore, the embedding biases from STFE correspond to biases or distortions introduced during hierarchical spatio-temporal feature extraction from raw fMRI data.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Understand what is inside the blue box (GCN)\n\nThe blue box contains multiple independent GCNs. Each GCN takes a generated connectome graph (from each level of STFE output) as input and extracts higher-level graph embeddings. Outputs of all GCNs are concatenated and passed to an MLP classifier to predict Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis.\n\n**Thus, the GCNs drive the AD classification by learning from these multi-level connectomes generated from STFE.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Meaning of embedding bias from STFE and its effects on fairness in GCN-driven AD classification\n\n**Embedding biases from STFE** would be systematic distortions, inaccuracies, or limitations in the hierarchical feature extraction step that produce the graphs subsequently used by the GCNs for classification.\n\n- If STFE embeddings are biased, e.g., favor some features or regions disproportionately, some clinical patterns might be over- or under-represented.\n- This bias propagates to graph generation, leading to connectomes that emphasize some neural regions or connections while ignoring others.\n- The GCNs, trained on these biased graphs, will incorporate and potentially amplify these biases.\n  \n**Effect on fairness:**\n\n- Fairness in ML means that predictions should be unbiased across different groups (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, or disease subtypes).\n- Embedding biases in STFE may cause the GCN to be less accurate or systematically err on under-represented subgroups.\n- For instance, if STFE is less sensitive to features in certain demographics or disease stages, the GCN classifier's decision boundary may be skewed.\n- This could lead to unfair classification outcomes, misdiagnosis, or less reliable detection of AD in certain groups.\n- Also, since the STFE is hierarchical and multi-scale, biases could cause loss of important patterns at certain scales, affecting the richness and diversity of input to GCNs.\n\n---\n\n### Final summary answer:\n\nEmbedding biases from the **STFE module** (the red box) can propagate through the graph generation process, leading to biased or incomplete multi-level connectomes that serve as input to the **GCN-driven AD classification** (the blue box). Such biases can affect fairness by causing the GCNs to learn from distorted or unrepresentative features, potentially resulting in systematically poorer prediction performance for certain subject groups or AD subtypes. Therefore, embedding biases in STFE may reduce the generalizability and equitable accuracy of the AD classifiers relying on GCNs.\n\n---\n\n# **Final answer:**\n\nEmbedding biases from the **spatio-temporal feature extractor (STFE)** can introduce systematic distortions in the extracted hierarchical temporal and spatial features of the fMRI data, which are used to build multi-level brain connectome graphs. These biased embeddings result in connectomes that may overemphasize or underrepresent certain brain regions or connectivity patterns. When such biased graphs are input to the **graph convolutional networks (GCNs)** driving AD classification, the learned representations and subsequent predictions can become skewed, leading to unfair classification outcomes. This can manifest as reduced accuracy or biased diagnostic predictions across different patient subgroups, thereby impacting the fairness of the GCN-driven AD classification."

Unlike correlation-sensitive methods, which consider symmetric co-occurrence patterns, causation-sensitive approaches understand how certain anchor items significantly influence the relevance of other complementary items depending on individual user preferences. This leads to improved personalization and bundle recommendation accuracy by modeling the real-world asymmetrical dependencies between bundle items.\n\n---\n\n**In brief:**  \nCausation-sensitive recommendation is motivated by the limitations of correlation-based methods that fail to capture the asymmetric influence of items within bundles, which is crucial to accurately reflect user preferences and improve bundle recommendation effectiveness."

Some items strongly influence the likelihood or preference for the tie, others weakly.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: How does [mask1] assign high and low affect weights?\n\n- From section 3.3.1 and 3.3.2, the Multi-Prospect Causation Network learns **asymmetric causation weights** \\(w_{i,j}^k\\) between pairs of items under different \"prospects\" \\(k\\).\n\n- Each edge weight corresponds to the influence strength from one item to another.\n\n- These weights are learned via:\n\n  - Combining item representations \\(x_i\\), \\(x_j\\) for source and destination items.\n  - Passing through a non-linear activation with learnable parameters.\n  - Applying a GATv2-style attention mechanism to compute normalized attention coefficients (weights) \\(C_k(i,j)\\).\n  \n- This process naturally generates **varying influence (affect) weights** for different item pairs.\n\n- Hence, \"high affect\" means a strong causation weight assigned to an item influencing another (e.g., shoes to tie), while \"low affect\" implies a smaller weight.\n\n- The multi-prospect framework allows capturing different aspects and reasons (prospects) behind these influences, making the overall causation sensitive to diverse user preferences or bundling strategies.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary:\n\n**[mask1], i.e., the Multi-Prospect Causation Network (MPCNet), assigns high and low affect weights across item relations by learning multiple asymmetric causation-sensitive weights between item pairs for various \"prospects\" (user preferences or bundling strategies). It computes these weights by applying learnable transformations and attention mechanisms over item embeddings, capturing how strongly one item influences the presence or preference of another under different perspectives. This enables distinguishing items with strong (\"high affect\") and weak (\"low affect\") influence in bundle recommendation decisions.**\n\n---\n\n# **Answer:**\n\nThe Multi-Prospect Causation Network (MPCNet) in [mask1] assigns high and low affect weights across item relations by modeling asymmetric causation-sensitive influences between item pairs from multiple learned perspectives (\"prospects\"). For each prospect, MPCNet computes influence weights using learnable item representations combined via nonlinear transformations and an attention mechanism, which captures how much one item affects another. This results in varying weights that highlight strong (\"high affect\") or weak (\"low affect\") influence relations among items, effectively distinguishing diverse user preferences and bundling strategies in the recommendation process."

This optimization minimizes the Chamfer Distance between the point cloud reconstructed by TGS from the perturbed image and a target pre-defined point cloud pattern (such as alphanumeric characters). Through iterative gradient updates, perturbations in the image space are crafted so that when TGS reconstructs the geometry, the resulting point cloud closely matches the target watermark pattern in a specific viewing direction.

However, the embedded watermark is typically lost or unrecoverable after 3D reconstruction with TGS, leading to failed extraction and no effective protection of the 3D output.**\n\n**In contrast, the geometry cloak perturbation mechanism ([mask2]) applies invisible adversarial perturbations optimized specifically to exploit the vulnerable explicit geometry features (point clouds) used by TGS. This perturbation causes the 3D reconstruction process to produce a compromised model exhibiting a verifiable pattern (or specific geometric distortion), effectively preventing unauthorized 3D reconstruction and providing a direct, view-specific watermark visible in the 3D output. Unlike digital watermarking, geometry cloaking focuses on disrupting and controlling the 3D reconstruction via perturbing geometry rather than embedding and extracting messages in the 2D pixel domain.**"

Here, given the prior set of operation states \\( M_{op} \\) and language input features \\( X_L \\), a new set of \\( N \\) latent operations \\( Z_{op} \\) are formed through an attention operation \\( Q_L K V_L \\). Specifically, the previously computed operation states \\( M_{op} \\) form the query \\( Q_L \\), and the language features \\( X_L \\) form the keys and values \\( K, V_L \\) to retrieve relevant language context that defines the new latent operations.\n\n2. **What does setting N parallel operations mean here?**  \n   The number \\( N \\) denotes how many parallel latent operations are formed at this step. The output \\( Z_{op} \\) is a set of \\( N \\) operations, formed in parallel through the attention mechanism.\n\n3. **How does this influence subsequent Operation Execution?**  \n   Moving to the next stage (Operation Execution), the new latent operations \\( Z_{op} \\) from the Operation Formation stage are used alongside the prior result states \\( M_{res} \\) to query the visual features \\( X_V \\). This is realized through another attention mechanism modulated by both \\( Z_{op} \\) and \\( M_{res} \\) to retrieve the new set of results \\( Z_{res} \\).\n\n4. **Effect of number of parallel operations \\( N \\):**  \n   - Since \\( N \\) determines the number of latent operations formed in parallel, it directly sets the dimensionality/quantity of the queries \\( Q_V \\) into \\( X_V \\) during Operation Execution.  \n   - A higher \\( N \\) means more parallel latent operations co-exist at each reasoning step, leading to more parallel queries to visual features, potentially capturing richer or more diverse aspects of the visual data simultaneously.  \n   - This parallelism affects computational complexity, the representation capacity, and how the visual attention is distributed across these operations.  \n   - Furthermore, these operations are later composed/interacted within the Operation Composition stage, so the choice of \\( N \\) affects how much interaction and refinement is possible among the parallel operations.\n\n5. **Summary:**  \n   Setting \\( N \\) parallel operations during Operation Formation produces \\( N \\) latent operation queries \\( Z_{op} \\). These queries jointly with prior result states form the attentional queries during Operation Execution, influencing *what and how many* visual features are attended to simultaneously. Thus, the number of parallel operations directly shapes the capacity and granularity of visual grounding at each reasoning step.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\nSetting \\( N \\) parallel operations in the Operation Formation stage determines the number of latent operations \\( Z_{op} \\) formed simultaneously from language features. This directly influences the subsequent Operation Execution dynamics by defining how many parallel queries are generated to attend to the visual features \\( X_V \\). Consequently, \\( N \\) controls the degree of parallelism in joint visual-language attention, enabling the model to concurrently retrieve multiple visual results \\( Z_{res} \\) guided by these operations and the prior results, which ultimately affects the richness, diversity, and interaction potential of the visual reasoning process at each step."

Traditional (single LLM directly producing output)  \n  2. Traditional + Meta (single LLM output enhanced by a meta-classifier)  \n  3. LLM + LLM + Meta (Ensemble stacking method combining multiple LLM outputs using stacking into a meta model)\n\n- In the third panel (bottom), multiple LLMs contribute outputs, denoted by two LLM icons being added together. Their outputs go into \"Ensemble methods\" which leads into **Stacking** (red box). The stacking output then becomes input for the **Meta model** (blue box).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: What does the context say about stacking and meta model?\n\n- **Ensemble stacking method (Section III-D):**  \n  - Multiple base LLM models (CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, UniXcoder) produce probability distributions over vulnerability classes for a given code snippet.  \n  - These outputs are concatenated into a meta-feature vector.  \n  - Multiple meta-classifiers (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, SVM, XGBoost) are trained on these meta-features to optimally combine predictions.  \n  - This process of combining outputs from multiple models to generate a new feature representation is called **stacking**.  \n  - The meta-classifier selected after training is used to produce the final vulnerability class prediction.\n\n- **Meta-model role:**  \n  From the context and the diagram, the meta-model corresponds to the trained meta-classifier which consumes the stacked meta-features and outputs final predictions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Chain-of-thought reasoning\n\n- The **Stacking (red box) module** takes the outputs (probability distributions) from multiple LLMs, combines (concatenates) them into a meta-feature vector for each sample. This process consolidates the different model outputs into a single representation capturing diverse perspectives.\n\n- This consolidated meta-feature vector is then fed into the **Meta model (blue box)**, which corresponds to a meta-classifier (like logistic regression, random forest, etc.) trained to optimally leverage these combined signals for final vulnerability classification.\n\n- Thus, stacking acts as the method for pooling and structuring multiple predictions into one feature space; the meta-model then uses this stacked input to make an informed final prediction.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe **Stacking** module ([mask1]) consolidates the probability outputs from multiple fine-tuned LLMs by concatenating them into a unified meta-feature vector for each code snippet. This meta-feature vector captures the collective predictive information of all base LLMs. The **Meta model** ([mask2]) then receives these stacked meta-features and applies a trained meta-classifier (such as logistic regression, random forest, SVM, or XGBoost) to make the final vulnerability class predictions. Essentially, stacking integrates and structures multiple LLM outputs, which the meta-model leverages to produce more accurate, combined predictions."

LLM + LLM + Meta (Current Methods) (bottom) with an emphasis on ensemble stacking.  \n\n- The red box highlights \"**Stacking**\" within the \"LLM + LLM + Meta (Current Methods)\" block (bottom section).  \n- This stacking is part of the ensemble methods combining multiple LLM outputs, refined further by a meta-model to improve vulnerability detection accuracy.  \n\nHence, **[mask1] corresponds to \"Stacking\" of multiple LLMs using ensemble-based techniques, combined with a meta-classifier to improve detection models in vulnerability detection systems.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Understand what stacking of LLMs involves  \n- Stacking here means combining predictions from multiple base models (CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, UniXcoder) using meta-classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM).  \n- This approach leverages diverse strengths of different LLMs to achieve superior performance than individual models.  \n- The stacking process involves creating meta-features from base models' predictions and training a meta-classifier to optimize final decision.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Review potential ethical concerns related to using stacked LLMs in vulnerability detection systems  \nThe literature excerpt does not explicitly discuss ethical concerns. However, based on insights from the description, limitations, and nature of these models, one can reason about possible ethical concerns:\n\n1. **Bias and Incomplete Training Data**  \n   - The datasets are imbalanced (severe class imbalance, underrepresented vulnerability classes), which may bias the stacked model’s predictions, potentially missing less frequent but critical vulnerabilities.  \n   - This raises concerns about fairness and reliability, potentially ignoring certain classes of vulnerabilities important for security.  \n\n2. **Explainability and Transparency**  \n   - Ensemble models combining multiple complex LLMs and meta-classifiers may become opaque (\"black boxes\"), making it difficult to explain why certain vulnerabilities are flagged or missed.  \n   - Lack of explainability can hinder trust and accountability in security-critical systems.\n\n3. **Overfitting and Generalizability**  \n   - Downsampling to deal with imbalance may reduce diversity and cause the model to underperform on unseen or rare vulnerabilities.  \n   - If these stacked models are deployed in real environments, they might fail to generalize, leaving software vulnerable to zero-day or newly emerging exploits.\n\n4. **Computational Overhead and Accessibility**  \n   - Ensemble stacking demands significant computational resources, potentially limiting access to well-resourced organizations only, leading to an ethical divide in security capabilities.\n\n5. **Reliance on Automated Systems**  \n   - Over-reliance on LLM-based systems risks automation bias, where human analysts might overly trust machine predictions and overlook subtle vulnerabilities not detected by the model.\n\n6. **Data Privacy and Security**  \n   - Training models on proprietary or sensitive codebases may raise concerns regarding data privacy and intellectual property if data handling and security are not properly managed.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Cross-check with provided context if any ethical concerns are explicitly or implicitly mentioned  \n- The **Limitations** section mentions computational cost, class imbalance, and dataset dependence but does not explicitly discuss ethical concerns.  \n- No direct mention of ethics, but the limitations imply some risks related to dataset biases and applicability, which can translate to ethical considerations as reasoned above.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:  \n**Ethical concerns arising from stacking LLMs (ensemble-based techniques) in vulnerability detection systems include:**  \n- The risk of biased predictions due to imbalanced and underrepresented vulnerability classes in training data, potentially leading to unfair or incomplete detection outcomes.  \n- Reduced transparency and explainability of stacked ensemble models, which complicates accountability and trust in automatic vulnerability detectors.  \n- Limited generalization of models due to dataset and training constraints, raising concerns about reliability in diverse or real-world applications.  \n- Increased computational demands, potentially restricting access and creating inequality between organizations with varying resources.  \n- Potential over-reliance on automated LLM ensembles might lead to automation bias, where human experts neglect critical manual review.  \n- Privacy and security issues related to training data handling could arise if sensitive code is used improperly during model training.\n\n---\n\nIf the question requires strictly the content from the context provided, note that ethical concerns are **not explicitly stated** but can be reasonably inferred from limitations and the nature of ensemble LLMs.\n\n---\n\n**Therefore, the best complete answer to the question based on the given context and figure is:**\n\n**Ethical concerns associated with stacking multiple LLMs in vulnerability detection systems primarily revolve around model bias due to imbalanced datasets, challenges with explainability and transparency of ensemble models, potential generalization failures to rare or unseen vulnerabilities, computational resource demands limiting accessibility, risks of automation bias from over-reliance on AI predictions, and issues related to data privacy and security when handling proprietary code.**"

Purpose of ADM: The Attribute Decoupling Mechanism aims to address the problems of data scarcity and subject overfitting that arise when fine-tuning pretrained inpainting models for subject-driven image generation.\n\n2. Problem of Subject Overfitting: The context explains that few-shot fine-tuning methods like DreamBooth inject all object attributes (color, texture, shape, etc.) into a single identity token. This causes the model to overfit to a very specific appearance described by simple prompts (like \"a brown clay teapot\").\n\n3. Concept Infusion Bias: When fine-tuning with regular data generated from simplified or entangled attributes, attribute words mix details unintentionally. For example, the word \"brown\" might become entangled with specific texture details. This phenomenon is referred to as \"Concept Infusion.\"\n\n4. Bias Impact: Concept Infusion results in the model having difficulty generalizing attribute editing because changing one attribute (e.g., color or material) may inadvertently affect others. This leads to reduced flexibility in editing, and poor editing quality when trying to switch attributes (e.g., switching from \"clay\" to \"glass\" or changing color).\n\n5. ADM's Solution: To mitigate this bias, ADM automatically reconstructs diverse, more detailed textual prompts that explicitly decouple different attributes using Vision-Language Models (VLMs). This creates regular data with varied attribute combinations for finetuning.\n\n6. Furthermore, a loss weight reallocation emphasizes the inpainting mask region to improve focus on the edited area, which helps to alleviate background noise interference.\n\n7. By combining the source subject data with this diverse, decoupled attribute data (\"regular data\") during fine-tuning with an adjusted loss, the ADM reduces the concept infusion bias and subject overfitting, promoting better attribute-level editing and diversity.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\nThe Attribute Decoupling Mechanism (ADM) can introduce biases known as \"Concept Infusion\" when generating regular data for finetuning. This bias occurs because attribute words (e.g., color, material, texture) may inadvertently bind detailed features to one another during fine-tuning, causing the model to overfit to entangled, overly specific attribute representations. As a result, it becomes difficult to flexibly and accurately edit individual object attributes during image generation, limiting the model's generalization and controllability in text-driven attribute editing."

The Attribute Dict contains detailed descriptions of the subject’s attributes (e.g., material, color), automatically extracted from reference images using a powerful Vision-Language Model (VLM).\n\n2. This detailed attribute extraction can result in very specific and unique information about an individual's personal objects or subjects being encoded in the Attribute Dict.\n\n3. Incorporating detailed attribute information into the Textual Attribute Substitution pipeline implies that extensive attribute data is used to guide inpainting and editing.\n\n4. Since the Attribute Dict is derived from images that likely come from user-provided data (potentially personal or sensitive images), this process involves capturing and utilizing fine-grained details of these images.\n\n5. Privacy concerns arise because the detailed extraction and use of attribute-level information could inadvertently expose or leak sensitive or identifiable information about individuals or their possessions if these data are shared, processed, or stored in an insecure manner.\n\n6. Moreover, if the VLM Agent or the system stores or transmits these detailed attribute descriptions without adequate protection, it may enable reconstruction or identification of private subjects or attributes.\n\n7. The pipeline's reliance on automated extraction also raises concerns about consent, data ownership, and potential misuse of these detailed descriptors.\n\nIn summary, the privacy concerns that arise from using the Attribute Dict (the detailed attribute data generated by the VLM Agent) in the Textual Attribute Substitution module include the risk of inadvertently disclosing sensitive, identifiable, or private attribute-level information about subjects captured in user images. This raises issues related to data leakage, unauthorized use of personal information, and the need for careful data handling and privacy-preserving measures when extracting and using detailed attribute descriptions for image inpainting and editing purposes."

It focuses on generating accurate local object content within the specified mask region, using a cropped local patch with added noise as input. This stage ensures well-defined layout and object appearance in the local area.  \n     - **Global Context Harmonization (GCH) [mask2]**: Occurs during the remaining denoising steps. It uses the intermediate output of LCG pasted back into the full image as guidance. This stage brings global harmony by aligning the locally generated content with the background image, eliminating any \"copy-paste\" artifacts or disharmonious appearance between the filled region and the surroundings.\n\n4. **Benefits of the Separation**:  \n   - The two-step decomposition allows the model to first accurately generate local content focusing solely on the masked region without the distraction of the global context.  \n   - Then, it refines and blends the local generation globally to ensure visual coherence and harmonious appearance, overcoming the limitations caused by large downsampling in latent diffusion.\n\n**Answer**:  \nThe motivation for separating inpainting into the Local Content Generation (LCG) and Global Context Harmonization (GCH) stages is to exploit the coarse-to-fine generation capability of diffusion models by first focusing on generating accurate, well-defined local object content within the masked region (LCG), and subsequently refining this local generation to achieve global visual harmony with the background image (GCH).

The context explains that during testing, to enhance the editability of the subject-driven inpainting method, the authors propose a Textual Attribute Substitution (TAS) module.\n\n2. Given a user text prompt containing attributes, the model retrieves matched attributes from the attribute dictionary (produced during attribute decoupling in training).\n\n3.

The key operation in the TAS module is to use the orthogonal decomposition strategy ([mask1]) on these text embeddings. This strategy decomposes the user prompt embedding into two components: one along the eliminated attribute embedding direction (to be removed) and the orthogonal component, which is the decomposed text embedding ([mask2]).\n\n5. The motivation for using this orthogonal decomposition ([mask1]) to produce the decomposed text embedding ([mask2]) is to remove the influence of the original object's identity attributes from the text prompt embedding.

It does so by evenly spacing intermediate quaternions along the shortest path in quaternion space (the 4D unit sphere), producing multiple rotation quaternions that, when converted to rotation matrices, correspond to distinct and well-separated 3D rotations in SO(3). This uniform sampling of rotations ensures that the multi-group tri-plane groups capture different viewpoints and diverse aggregations of the point cloud features, preserving more key information and improving shape representation for local occupancy estimation."

Understand the function of these two components from the context:\n   - Multi-Group Tri-Plane ([mask1]) aggregates global scene context:\n     - It uses multiple groups of tri-planes, each consisting of three orthogonal 2D planes, to pool spatial features projected from the 3D point cloud embedding and point density along each axis.\n     - Each group's tri-planes are rotated differently to capture diverse and complementary information.\n     - After projecting and aggregating features on these planes, group-shared plane encoders generate multi-group tri-plane features.\n   - Local Context ([mask2]) represents fine, localized shape information derived from:\n     - Observed point clouds,\n     - Position embeddings relative to the nearest grasp point,\n     - Nearest neighbor search in the input point cloud embedding,\n     - Processed via MLP for position embedding.\n\n3.

It is connected between Differentiable Rasterization outputs and the 3D Gaussians input, implying it modulates the properties of these Gaussians.\n\n2. **Understanding Exposure Event Loss**  \n   The exposure event loss is described in the text (Sec. III-C Loss Functions) as:  \n   > \"The exposure event loss supervises the 3DGS reconstruction of high-quality frames obtained from a temporal-to-intensity mapping of exposure events. It is computed as the L2 loss between predicted images and ground truth intensity frames.\"  \n   \n   This loss incorporates rich texture information from exposure events into the training, guiding the reconstruction of high-fidelity appearance details in the 3D scene.\n\n3. **Role of Adaptive Density Control**  \n   From the diagram, adaptive density control takes rendered frames from differentiable rasterization and outputs refined 3D Gaussians. The text implies this adaptive density control modulates or refines the Gaussian splats' densities based on supervisory signals to improve reconstruction quality.\n   \n   Specifically, the term \"Adaptive Density Control\" suggests a mechanism that dynamically adjusts the densities of 3D Gaussians, likely depending on error feedback from losses.\n\n4. **How Exposure Event Loss Shapes Adaptive Density Control**  \n   The **exposure event loss** provides rich spatial supervision from exposure events (grayscale images generated via temporal-to-intensity mapping). This supervision signals the reconstruction quality and errors in the rendered output compared to the mapped high-quality intensity images.\n\n   Based on the error gradients flowing from the exposure event loss (red arrows in the diagram), these feed back through the Differentiable Rasterization module to the Adaptive Density Control module (blue box).\n\n   Therefore:  \n   - The Exposure Event Loss **generates gradient feedback** indicating where rendering fails to match ground truth intensities.  \n   - This feedback is used by the Adaptive Density Control module to **adjust the densities of the 3D Gaussians** (their spatial extent and opacity), specifically refining regions where intensity reconstruction is inaccurate.  \n   - By adaptively controlling the density, it enhances the fitting of 3D Gaussians to better represent spatial details and textures present in the exposure event images.\n\n5. **Result**  \n   Through this feedback loop, the exposure event loss constrains the 3DGS optimization, guiding the adaptive density control mechanism to refine 3D Gaussian parameters (position, scale, density) and thus improving the overall model's quality and detail in the explicit 3D reconstruction.\n\n---\n\n### Concise answer:\n\n**The Exposure Event Loss supervises the training by comparing the predicted rendered images to high-quality intensity images derived from exposure events. The gradient feedback from this loss flows into the Adaptive Density Control module, which uses this information to dynamically adjust the densities of the 3D Gaussians. This adaptive modulation refines the Gaussians’ spatial properties, leading to enhanced reconstruction quality by better fitting the scene’s textures and details encoded in the exposure events.**\n\n---\n\nThis answer aligns directly with both the diagram’s flow (loss to density control to 3D Gaussians) and the detailed descriptions in the context about how exposure event information enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction quality."

This leads to more representative and evenly distributed Gaussians that, when passed to Differentiable Rasterization, enable higher-quality and more accurate rendering of the scene projections. Consequently, the improved rasterization supports better supervision using motion and exposure event losses, enhancing scene sampling and reconstruction quality.\n\n---\n\n# Final Answer:\n\nThe **Adaptive Density Control** (red box) dynamically adjusts the density and spatial distribution of the 3D Gaussians to optimize their coverage and representation of the scene. By doing so, it ensures that the set of Gaussians fed into the **Differentiable Rasterization** (blue box) step is well-distributed and efficiently represents the scene geometry and appearance. This optimized Gaussian density allows the rasterization process to produce higher-quality rendered images that align better with the event-based supervisory signals. As a result, Adaptive Density Control improves the effectiveness and accuracy of Differentiable Rasterization in sampling the scene, leading to better 3D reconstruction performance."

This module is detailed in the text under \"Comparison of Distribution\" in the Methods section.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **What is being compared?**\n\n   The distributions being compared are multi-dimensional Gaussian distributions representing the facial beauty (FB) uncertainty or variability of each facial image. These distributions encode the human cognition inconsistency regarding FB ratings.\n\n2. **How is variability represented?**\n\n   Variability (uncertainty) is modeled as the covariance matrix (specifically a diagonal covariance matrix) of a Gaussian distribution in a high-dimensional psychological scale space. The dispersion (variability) is quantified as the Frobenius norm of the covariance matrix.\n\n3. **Purpose of Distribution Comparison:**\n\n   Conventional order learning compares fixed feature points for determining relative order but cannot directly compare distributions.\n\n   The Distribution Comparison module enables order learning to operate on uncertain data represented as distributions, thus addressing the human cognition variability in FB ratings.\n\n4. **Method used in Distribution Comparison:**\n\n   - Use Monte Carlo sampling to draw multiple samples from each Gaussian distribution, simulating observations of multiple subjects rating the stimulus.\n\n   - Compute the pairwise order relations between these sampled feature points using a comparator network trained via cross-entropy loss on triple-class classification (whether score1 > score2, approximate equal, or < score2).\n\n   - Aggregate multiple comparisons (via sampling) to estimate the overall order relation between two uncertain distributions.\n\n5. **Stability under limited computational resources:**\n\n   Since Monte Carlo sampling requires multiple samples (T times) for stable estimation, higher variability (covariance) in distributions increases the uncertainty in comparisons.\n\n   However, with limited computational resources (small T), sampling variability could cause instability in estimating the order relation between two distributions with high variability.\n\n   The method mitigates this by:\n\n   - Applying a hinge loss on the Wasserstein distance between distributions to enforce that instances with similar scores have closer distributions and those with different scores have farther distributions.\n\n   - Using KL loss to constrain modeled uncertainty to match human rating variance, improving the fidelity of uncertainty estimation.\n\n   - Combining these constraints improves the learned distribution representations, which in turn stabilize comparisons even under limited sampling.\n\n6. **Summary:**\n\n   The variability of the distributions (uncertainty due to human cognition inconsistencies) directly impacts the stability of distribution comparison because greater uncertainty implies more spread in the sampled features, increasing variance in predicted order.\n\n   The Monte Carlo sampling-based comparison leverages multiple draws to average out stochastic effects; however, limited samples can lead to unstable approximations.\n\n   To maintain stability under limited computational resources, the network is trained with constraints (hinge loss on Wasserstein distance and KL loss on variance) to produce well-structured distributions where similar instances cluster closely and uncertainty matches human rating variance. This structured modeling reduces variability-induced instability.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe variability of the distributions—modeled as multi-dimensional Gaussian distributions representing human rating uncertainty—affects the stability of distribution comparison by introducing stochasticity in Monte Carlo sampling-based order estimation. Higher variability can lead to less stable order predictions, especially under limited computational resources that restrict the number of samples drawn. To counter this, the method uses hinge loss to enforce appropriate distances between distributions and KL loss to align predicted variances with true rating variances, thereby structuring the distribution representations to be more discriminative and stable. This improves the robustness and reliability of distribution comparisons despite limited sampling and computational constraints."

This \"MaxRényi-K%\" is the metric used to determine the membership of the target data (image or text) in the training set.\n\n- **Textual context**: \n  - The MaxRényi-K% metric uses Rényi entropy computed over the next-token probability distributions output by the model.\n  - It is a target-free metric that averages the largest K% Rényi entropies across the token sequence.\n  - In the image MIA (membership inference attack) setting, the logits are separated into slices corresponding to image, instruction, and description tokens, allowing the calculation of membership scores from each segment.\n  - Target-free methods like MaxRényi-K% are essential for image tokens because there are no ground-truth image tokens for direct target-based MIA.\n  - The method uses the entire probability distribution over tokens, not just the single next token, to assess membership likelihood.\n  - The method is compared to baselines and shown to be effective for MIA on VLLMs.\n\n---\n\n**Question:**  \nWhat challenges might arise from computing [mask1] exclusively on image slice logits?\n\n[mask1] = MaxRényi-K%\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **What is the image slice logits?**  \n   The image slice logits correspond to the output probability distribution over tokens generated by the model before the instruction and description text tokens. The logits are generated from the image embedding projected into the LLM's input space.\n\n2. **Why consider computing MaxRényi-K% exclusively on the image slice logits?**  \n   Since the MIA aims to detect whether an image was part of the training data, it could be intuitive to just look at the image slice logits alone.\n\n3. **Challenges arising from this approach:**\n\n   - **Absence of ground-truth image tokens:**  \n     Unlike textual tokens, the image input to VLLMs is not represented as discrete tokens with ground-truth next tokens for direct language-model-like evaluation. The image slice corresponds to embeddings derived from the image, not explicit tokens from a known vocabulary.  \n     This absence limits the interpretability and discriminative power of the logits from the image slice alone.\n\n   - **Limited information and context:**  \n     The image slice logits alone represent the model’s internal representation of the image embedding but do not contain the richer context that follows in instructions or textual descriptions, which can reinforce membership signals.  \n     The description and instruction slices provide grounded textual data that the model generates conditioned on the image, adding predictive power.\n\n   - **No target tokens for target-based MIAs:**  \n     Since there are no \"next token\" targets for the image slice, traditional target-based MIAs (which rely on comparing predicted probabilities at known next tokens) are not feasible on the image slice alone.\n\n   - **Lower confidence and noisier signals:**  \n     The uncertainty (entropy) in the image slice logits may be inherently higher or less stable since it corresponds to raw visual embeddings rather than actual verbal predictions, reducing the sensitivity of entropy-based membership detection metrics.\n\n   - **Possibility of unstable or erratic metric values:**  \n     Target-based MIAs can sometimes show instability when applied to instruction slice logits, per the text. It is plausible similar or worse instability arises when only considering image slices, which may degrade MIA accuracy.\n\n4. **Empirical evidence from the text:**  \n   The text mentions that target-free metrics applied on the image slice outperform target-based metrics, but the instruction slice sometimes resulted in unstable AUC values. Also, since the image slice does not have ground truth tokens, only target-free metrics can be used. Despite this, relying exclusively on the image slice logits for computing MaxRényi-K% might be less effective than a cross-modal approach that also considers instruction and description slices.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of challenges:**\n\n- Lack of ground-truth tokens for the image slice makes target-based MIA impossible and target-free metrics less informative.\n- The image logits represent embeddings with less direct semantic interpretation, leading to noisier or less discriminative entropy values.\n- Potentially reduced confidence and stability in membership inference signals, resulting in lower attack performance.\n- No additional contextual information that emerges from text (instructions or descriptions), which enrich membership signals in a cross-modal pipeline.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\nComputing MaxRényi-K% exclusively on the image slice logits poses challenges due to the absence of ground-truth image tokens, which precludes target-based MIA and limits the interpretability of the logits. The image slice logits represent embeddings rather than discrete tokens, resulting in noisier and less discriminative entropy signals. Without the contextual reinforcement from instruction and description text slices, membership inference metrics based solely on image slice logits may suffer from instability, reduced confidence, and overall degraded detection performance."

Identify what [mask1] in the question refers to in the diagram:  \n   The red box in the figure highlights the \"description\" slice of the output logits from the VLLM during the inference stage. This corresponds to the generated text (description) part of the model’s output token sequence logits.\n\n2. Understand the context of utilizing the \"description\" slice logits for membership inference:  \n   - The membership inference attack (MIA) pipeline described feeds the model with an image, instruction, and then the generated description text, and then extracts logits corresponding to different token slices—image, instruction, and description.  \n   - The \"description\" slice logits are the predicted distributions over tokens for the generated description text.  \n   - The MaxRényi-K% metric is applied to these logits, which measures Rényi entropy over next-token distributions.

Using them for MIAs can expose whether a particular description (text data) was part of the model training set, revealing sensitive or private information contained in the training data.\n   \n   - **Training Data Confidentiality Risks**: Since the description slice reflects the model’s learned knowledge, applying MIAs here can risk unauthorized disclosure of proprietary or private datasets used to train the VLLM, violating data owners' privacy agreements and IP protections.\n   \n   - **Potential for Exploitation**: Attackers could leverage the description slice logits to infer membership of sensitive descriptions, which could include personal, medical, or confidential textual information, thereby compromising user trust and ethical norms.\n   \n   - **Cross-modal Privacy Threat**: Since the description logits come from a vision-language model, extracting membership info from text generated based on images may link back private images to text, exacerbating privacy concerns.\n   \n   - **Opaque Model Behavior and Unintended Memorization**: Using description slice logits for MIAs highlights the model's ability to memorize and leak training data, raising ethical concerns about the limits of model transparency, control, and fairness.\n\n4.

This can enable attackers to detect and exploit whether specific textual data were used during training, leading to unauthorized disclosure of personal, proprietary, or confidential information.

        "response": "Step 1: Understand the [mask1] and [mask2] from the image and context.\n\n- The [mask1] is the red box in the image and corresponds to the \"generation stage\" in the pipeline, as described under the figure caption and the context. This stage involves taking the target image \\(Z\\) and an instruction \\(X_{ins}\\) (e.g., \"Describe this image.\") and feeding them into the target VLLM to generate a textual description \\(X'_{des}\\) of the image (e.g., \"A skier descending a steep, snow-covered slope.\").\n\n- The [mask2] is the blue box in the image and corresponds to the \"inference stage\" of the pipeline. At this stage, the model is fed with the concatenation of the image, the instruction, and the generated description text. The output logits are sliced into three segments: image tokens, instruction tokens, and description tokens. These slices are used to compute metrics (like MaxRényi-K%) to detect whether the image was a member of the training data.\n\nStep 2: Reason about the question: \"What motivates using separate [mask1] and [mask2] in the image detection pipeline?\"\n\n- From the context's \"Method\" section:\n\n  - The reason for two stages is related to the absence of ground-truth image tokens. Only the image embeddings are available, so direct target-based MIA (membership inference attacks) from language is hindered.\n\n  - The generation stage ([mask1], red box) generates a textual description of the image by feeding the image + instruction into the model. This textual description acts as the \"proxy\" or \"target\" textual data associated with the image.\n\n  - The inference stage ([mask2], blue box) concatenates image + instruction + generated description and extracts logits for each token type to perform token-level membership inference attacks.\n\n- By separating the pipeline into two stages, the method leverages the generated description as a bridge between the image embedding and text space—allowing token-level MIA metrics to be computed.\n\n- Additionally, segmenting logits into image, instruction, and description tokens in the inference stage provides flexibility: even if some logits (e.g., for image or instruction tokens) are unavailable, membership detection can still be performed from the text tokens alone.\n\n- This separation thus overcomes the challenge of not having ground-truth image tokens, enables use of textual token logits for membership inference, and aligns with the causal language modeling framework where text tokens depend on previous image and instruction tokens.\n\nStep 3: Summarize:\n\nUsing separate generation ([mask1]) and inference ([mask2]) stages is motivated by the need to bridge the gap between image embeddings and textual tokens for membership inference attacks. The generation stage produces a descriptive text from an image and instruction, creating a textual sequence that the inference stage can evaluate together with the image and instruction tokens. This staged approach enables calculation of token-level metrics on logits for membership inference despite lacking ground-truth image tokens, and allows flexible incorporation of different token segments to enhance image detection accuracy.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\nThe motivation for using separate [mask1] (generation stage) and [mask2] (inference stage) in the image detection pipeline is to address the challenge that ground-truth image tokens are unavailable, and only image embeddings exist. In the generation stage ([mask1]), the model generates a textual description of the target image given the image and an instruction. This generated description serves as a bridge to link the image embedding space to a textual token sequence. In the inference stage ([mask2]), the model inputs the concatenation of the image, instruction, and generated description to obtain output logits, which are sliced into image, instruction, and description segments. These segments are then used to compute token-level metrics (e.g., MaxRényi-K%) for membership inference attacks. This separation enables the pipeline to perform image membership inference by leveraging generated text tokens despite lacking ground-truth image tokens and also provides flexibility to perform detection solely based on certain token segments when others are inaccessible."

Through this adversarial process, the generator's outputs influence the critic's updates by providing synthetic samples to evaluate, and the critic's learned feedback subsequently drives the generator's parameter updates. This interaction mirrors classical adversarial frameworks where generated outputs guide the discriminator/critic's learning, and its feedback guides the generator, using the real data as the ground truth reference."

This enables extraction of **distinct context-related personality and empathy features**.  \n- This contrasts with static or unconditional prefix vectors in original prefix-tuning.  \n- The approach therefore creates multi-grained prefix representations that capture different aspects (personality and empathy) conditioned explicitly on the context, enhancing the expressiveness and control of the prefix embeddings.\n\n### Step 4: Summarize  \nThe \"Context Attention\" module extends Li and Liang’s prefix-tuning cross-attention by introducing **two learnable query embeddings** that attend over the context encoding to dynamically produce separate prefix vectors representing personality and empathy features. This enriched, context-conditioned prefix generation enables the model to better incorporate multi-grained signals (personality and empathy) into prefix-tuning, beyond static learned prefixes.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe module highlighted by the red box (\"Context Attention\") extends prefix-tuning cross-attention mechanisms from Li and Liang by introducing two distinct learnable query embeddings that attend over the input context encoding to dynamically generate separate prefix vectors. These prefix vectors capture specific context-related personality and empathy features, thus enabling multi-grained, context-conditioned prefix embeddings rather than static prefixes. This allows the model to better encode and integrate personality and empathy signals into the prefix-tuning framework."

This section includes modules like RoBERTa encoders, Personality predictor, ECM (empathy) predictor, Intent predictor, Personality Attention, Empathy Attention, Context Attention, and how these are combined and transformed into prefix embeddings for the decoder DialoGPT.\n\nStep 2: Understand the roles of empathy attention and personality attention within the Multi-Grained Prefix Encoder.  \n- According to the context:  \n  - The Multi-Grained Prefix Encoder projects input context (c), retrieved response (r), empathy signals (e), and past responses of listener_n (p) into fixed-length prefix vectors.  \n  - It encodes these inputs with RoBERTa to continuous representations:  \n    - c → Vc (context embedding)  \n    - p → Vp (personality embedding from past responses)  \n    - e → Ve (empathy embedding from empathy signals)  \n  - Two learnable embeddings Q1 and Q2 serve as queries for the attention mechanism to separately extract context-related empathy and personality features.  \n  - A cross-attention mechanism uses context representation (Vc) as the key and value, and Q1, Q2 as queries to produce two prefix vectors: Intermediate prefix vectors related to personality and empathy.  \n  - Personality Attention takes (Kp, Vp, Qc1) — seems to mean keys and values from personality-related inputs, queries from context attention output — and outputs V_PC1, a context-personality prefix vector.  \n  - Empathy Attention takes (Ke, Ve, Qc2) — empathy-related key-value pairs, queries from context attention output — and outputs V_EC2, a context-empathy prefix vector.  \n  - These two vectors are fused with context related embeddings and concatenated along the length dimension, followed by a linear layer, producing the final prefix embeddings.  \n\nStep 3: Reason how these two attentions interrelate and impact prefix encoding:  \n- Empathy Attention and Personality Attention are parallel cross-attention modules that separately attend to empathy-related and personality-related inputs, respectively, using context as a guiding query.  \n- The outputs from these attentions capture distinct but complementary aspects of the conversation context: empathy signals and personality traits.  \n- They are each fused with the context embeddings, forming two distinct prefix vectors that explicitly encode context-personality and context-empathy relationships.  \n- By concatenating these prefix vectors along with context embeddings and applying a linear layer, the multi-grained prefix encoder combines personality and empathy information into a unified prefix embedding.  \n- This unified embedding is then prepended to the DialoGPT decoder to guide generation towards responses that jointly consider empathy and personality traits.  \n\nStep 4: Summarize the answer accordingly.\n\nFinal Answer:  \nWithin the Multi-Grained Prefix Encoder (the [mask1] area), Personality Attention and Empathy Attention operate in parallel to separately extract distinct features related to personality and empathy from the input embeddings, guided by the context. Each applies a cross-attention mechanism to fuse personality and empathy signals with context information, respectively, producing two distinct context-related prefix vectors. These vectors—one capturing context-personality relationships, the other context-empathy relationships—are combined with context embeddings and concatenated, then transformed via a linear layer into the final prefix embeddings. This integration allows the prefix encoder to encode multi-grained signals that jointly represent both personality traits and empathetic cues, thereby enabling the decoder to generate responses that reflect both personality and empathy effectively."

The EPI processes pose keypoints extracted from the driving video and applies pose transformations (Pose Realignment and Pose Rescale) before encoding these transformed poses to produce explicit pose features.\n\n2. **Purpose of Pose Rescale within EPI:**  \n   - The context explains that **Pose Rescale** involves applying keypoint rescaling operations to simulate anthropomorphic variations in body shape (e.g., changing lengths of body parts, face size, adding/removing parts).  \n   - This is critical because the characters animated are often not humans and can differ significantly in shape.  \n   - Without pose rescaling, only Pose Realignment is applied, which aligns poses based on human-like references but doesn't capture these shape variations.\n\n3. **Impact of simulating misalignments:**  \n   - The EPI is designed to make the model robust during inference by simulating misalignment scenarios between the reference image and driving poses that typically happen with anthropomorphic characters.  \n   - Pose Rescale simulates body shape differences, augmenting the pose images with realistic shape variations.\n\n4. **Effect of excluding Pose Rescale (w/o Rescale) based on Ablation Study:**  \n   - The ablation results (from the context) indicate that removing Pose Rescale reduces model robustness:  \n     - The model becomes less capable of handling shape differences between the reference and driving pose, leading to forced or incorrect alignment during animation.  \n     - While Pose Realignment has the biggest impact, Pose Rescale meaningfully improves robustness to pose-reference mismatches and shape variations.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**  \n   - Excluding Pose Rescale from EPI weakens the model’s ability to handle anthropomorphic pose misalignments caused by shape differences.\n   - The model is less robust to varying body proportions and may produce unnatural animations or misaligned parts.  \n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\nExcluding Pose Rescale in the Explicit Pose Indicator reduces the model’s robustness to pose misalignments, particularly those arising from differences in body shape and proportions between the reference image and driving pose. Without Pose Rescale, the model cannot adequately simulate or handle shape variations typical in anthropomorphic characters during training, leading to forced or incorrect pose alignment during inference and resulting in less natural and less accurate animations. Thus, Pose Rescale is essential for improving the model’s ability to manage misaligned inputs and produce robust, realistic animations."

This module includes:  \n  - The input pose keypoints \\(p^d\\) from DWPOSE (the pose detector),  \n  - The CLIP features \\(f^{d}_{\\varphi}\\) from the driving video,  \n  - The Transformer encoder with cross-attention and feed-forward networks to merge pose keypoints embeddings and CLIP image features into a merged query \\(q_m\\), which represents the implicit motion-related features.\n\nStep 2: Understand the role of CLIP features ([mask1]) within IPI ([mask2]) from context\n\n- The CLIP image feature extracted from the driving video \\(f^{d}_{\\varphi}\\) is a \"highly entangled representation\" that contains motion patterns and relations not directly represented by the sparse 2D pose skeletons \\(p^d\\).\n\n- The IPI merges these CLIP features and pose keypoints with a transformer architecture to extract \"essential motion patterns and relations that cannot be directly represented by the pose skeletons.\"\n\n- This improves the motion representation by adding implicit motion cues from the video frames, yielding better animation quality and helping to preserve identity.\n\nStep 3: Identify potential biases from relying on CLIP features inside IPI\n\n- The CLIP model is pre-trained on large-scale internet image-text pairs, mainly natural images and general internet data.\n\n- Thus, the CLIP features may implicitly encode biases from its training data, such as a human-centric view of poses and actions, or a bias towards natural human movements and appearances.\n\n- The text explicitly notes that diffusion models trained on human dance video datasets may \"introduce unrelated human characteristics,\" especially when applied to non-human anthropomorphic characters, resulting in \"abnormal distortions.\"\n\n- Similarly, reliance on CLIP features extracted from human-centric datasets/videos might cause the model to \"impose\" human-like features or motions onto non-human or anthropomorphic characters inadequately, because the CLIP feature representations may not generalize well to these out-of-distribution characters.\n\n- Therefore, a potential bias is that the use of CLIP image features within IPI (and broader Animate-X model) can propagate or amplify human-centered visual and motion representations, limiting generalization or causing unnatural animations for characters whose structure/motion deviate from typical human data.\n\nStep 4: Summarize the answer\n\nThe potential biases arising from relying on the CLIP features within the Implicit Pose Indicator (IPI) include a human-centric bias inherited from CLIP's training data and the human dance video datasets used in training Animate-X. This causes the model to sometimes impose human-like characteristics or motions on non-human anthropomorphic characters, resulting in distortions or unnatural animations that do not respect the unique physical structures of these characters.\n\n# Final Answer\n\nRelying on the CLIP features (the content in [mask1]) within the Implicit Pose Indicator (IPI) ([mask2]) introduces potential human-centric biases inherited from CLIP’s training on natural, primarily human-related images and from the human dance video datasets used. This bias can cause the model to impose human-like characteristics or motions onto non-human or anthropomorphic characters, leading to unnatural distortions and abnormal animations that fail to accurately represent characters with non-human body structures."

CLIP image encoder \\(\\Phi\\) which extracts image features \\(f_{\\varphi}^r\\) from the reference image.  \n  - VAE encoder \\(\\mathcal{E}\\) which extracts the latent feature \\(f_e^r\\) from the reference image.\n  - DWPose (pose keypoint extractor) applied to driven video.\n  - Another CLIP encoder extracts features of the driven video.\n  \n  These extracted features feed into **Implicit Pose Indicator (IPI)** and **Explicit Pose Indicator (EPI)** modules.\n\n- The blue box ([mask2]) encloses the large central block marked \\(\\epsilon_{\\theta}\\), which is the **diffusion model's denoising network**, specifically a 3D-UNet backbone comprising several Spatial Attention, Motion Attention, and Temporal Attention layers.\n\n- According to the caption and text, the diffusion model \\(\\epsilon_\\theta\\) takes as input:\n  - The concatenated explicit pose feature \\(f_e\\) and noised latent \\(\\epsilon\\) concatenated along channel dimension, further stacked with the latent image feature \\(f_e^r\\) along temporal dimension.\n  - Conditioning information including the implicit pose indicator feature \\(f_i\\) and CLIP reference image feature \\(f_{\\varphi}^r\\).\n  \n---\n\n### Step 2: Understand the role of [mask1] (encoders) in the framework\n\n- The encoders within the red box extract **rich identity and motion features**:\n  - CLIP encoder for image features captures semantic, identity-rich, and motion-related patterns implicitly.\n  - VAE encoder compresses image appearance into latent space.\n  - DWPose extracts pose keypoints for explicit motion representation.\n  \n- These encoders provide structured and disentangled features that help the model separate **appearance/identity** and **motion information**.\n\n- This combination supports the Pose Indicator modules:\n\n  - **Implicit Pose Indicator (IPI):** leverages CLIP features and sparse pose queries to learn deep motion representations that are implicit and holistic.\n  \n  - **Explicit Pose Indicator (EPI):** uses explicitly transformed pose images to help with pose alignment and robustness.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Role of [mask2] (the diffusion model \\(\\epsilon_\\theta\\))\n\n- The diffusion model denoises the latent video step-by-step, conditioned on the concatenated features from the encoders.\n\n- It incorporates **spatial, motion, and temporal attention** layers to model high-dimensional latent video generation in a spatiotemporally coherent manner.\n\n- The input feature conditioning from the encoders (including implicit and explicit pose features, CLIP-based image features, and latent codes) guides the diffusion process to generate realistic video frames preserving identity and following motion cues.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: What if [mask1] (the encoders) were replaced with GAN-based encoders?\n\n- GANs historically rely on adversarial training to learn generative latent spaces and usually encode features that are designed for image generation or discrimination.\n\n- From the context, the paper notes limitations with **GAN-based methods:**\n\n  - GANs often introduce artifacts.\n  \n  - Lack robustness in preserving identity and natural motion in challenging cases (see qualitative results).\n  \n  - GAN encoders might encode more entangled or less semantically rich features, especially for anthropomorphic characters not well covered in datasets.\n\n- The Animate-X approach uses **pretrained CLIP encoders and VAEs** for strong, disentangled representations.\n\n- Replacing the [mask1] encoders with GAN-based ones would likely impact the **quality and structure of extracted features**, possibly producing less semantically meaningful or disentangled motion and identity features.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: How would this affect [mask2] (diffusion model) and the overall generation?\n\n- The diffusion model \\(\\epsilon_{\\theta}\\) relies heavily on **high-quality conditioning features** for guiding denoising.\n\n- If conditioning features from encoders are degraded or less informative (as likely from GAN-based encoders):\n\n  - The model might receive noisier, entangled input features.\n  \n  - This reduces the effectiveness of the cross-attention in the spatial, motion, and temporal attention blocks.\n  \n  - The diffusion model would struggle to balance **identity preservation and motion consistency**, especially for challenging characters.\n  \n  - Could result in **more artifacts, less identity fidelity, and unnatural motions**.\n  \n  - The model might produce animations with **incorrect or ambiguous body parts or motions** (similar to GAN-based baseline behaviors described in the text).\n  \n  - Overall, the strength and robustness of Animate-X's motion representation would degrade.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary answer:**\n\nReplacing the encoders highlighted in [mask1] (such as CLIP and VAE encoder) with a GAN-based encoder would degrade the quality and semantic richness of the extracted features (identity and motion representations). This would negatively impact the diffusion model's ([mask2]) conditioning, reducing its ability to preserve character identity and accurately model motion. Consequently, the diffusion model's capacity to generate high-fidelity, temporally consistent animations with robust generalization to anthropomorphic characters would be compromised, potentially leading to artifacts, loss of identity fidelity, and unnatural or implausible motions.\n\n---\n\n# Final concise answer:\n\nReplacing the CLIP and VAE encoders ([mask1]) with a GAN-based encoder would provide less rich and disentangled identity and motion features to the diffusion model ([mask2]). This degradation in conditioning quality would impair the diffusion model’s ability to effectively align appearance and motion, resulting in decreased identity preservation, more artifacts, and less accurate motion consistency in the generated animations."

This component enables users to specify charts by blending graphical UI elements (like drag-and-drop encoding shelf for data fields) and natural language inputs. The Concept Encoding Shelf lets users define data fields (existing or new), visual channels, and provide natural language instructions that guide the AI to perform data transformations accordingly.\n\n**Step 2: What is the nature of the prompts in Concept Encoding Shelf?**\n\n- Prompts here are semi-structured: users configure chart encodings via UI and supplement with natural language instructions specifying new or transformed data.\n- The AI is tasked with interpreting these prompts and generating Python code to perform data transformation automatically.\n- The prompt reduces verbosity but still combines structured and natural language inputs.\n- The AI's data transformations encompass complex operations like reshaping, aggregation, filtering, and derivations.\n\n**Step 3: Considering ethical risks emerging from automating data transformation via AI from such prompts**\n\nFrom the text and Figure 1 description, the process is designed to simplify the data transformation burden on the user by leveraging AI. However, automating data transformation through AI on the basis of blended UI and NL inputs, such as those in the Concept Encoding Shelf, brings several potential **ethical risks**:\n\n1. **Misinterpretation or Ambiguity in User Intent Leading to Incorrect Data Transformations**\n\n   - Users provide natural language instructions that may be vague or imprecise.\n   - AI might misinterpret instructions or the intended semantics of new data fields.\n   - Resulting transformations could produce erroneous data or misleading visualizations.\n   - Without proper user understanding, this can propagate misinformation or false conclusions.\n\n2. **Over-reliance on AI Decisions Without Adequate Verification**\n\n   - Users, especially less proficient ones, may overly trust AI outputs without critically reviewing transformation code/data.\n   - Risk of unrecognized errors impacting downstream decisions.\n\n3. **Data Privacy and Security Risks**\n\n   - AI-generated transformations might unintentionally expose sensitive or private data, especially if prompts or intermediate outputs are logged or shared.\n   - Handling of data must be secure to prevent leaks.\n\n4. **Bias Amplification**\n\n   - AI models trained on existing data may propagate or amplify biases in the data.\n   - Automated transformations could unintentionally skew data or filter results in non-transparent ways.\n\n5. **Lack of Explainability**\n\n   - Although the system provides code explanations, many users may not fully understand AI-generated transformations.\n   - This creates a black box effect, where changes in data are opaque, posing ethical challenges in transparency and accountability.\n\n6. **Potential for Generating Harmful or Illegal Code**\n\n   - AI code generation might produce code that leads to unintended consequences (e.g., data corruption).\n   - Need safeguards to prevent unsafe operations.\n\n7. **Versioning and Provenance Risks**\n\n   - Complex branching and history (via data threads) necessitate clear provenance for traceability.\n   - Failure to adequately track changes could lead to misuse or misunderstanding of data origins.\n\n8. **User Skill Gap and Equity**\n\n   - The tool makes complex data transformations easier but also can widen the gap between skilled and unskilled users if novices fail to critically assess AI outputs.\n   - Unequal access to understanding the AI decisions can result in ethical concerns about fairness and inclusivity.\n\n**Step 4: The passage and the figure context explicitly mention some mitigation strategies:**\n\n- Displaying transformed data, code, and code explanations to help users verify AI outputs.\n- Allowing backtracking and iterative refining to correct mistakes.\n- Concept Encoding Shelf providing precise UI input to reduce ambiguity.\n\nDespite these, residual ethical risks remain due to the inherent limitations of AI understanding and user comprehension.\n\n---\n\n### **Final answer:**\n\nAutomating data transformation through AI based on blended UI and natural language prompts in the Concept Encoding Shelf introduces several ethical risks, including:\n\n- **Misinterpretation of user intent** causing incorrect or misleading data transformations and visualizations.\n- **Over-reliance on AI-generated outputs** without sufficient user verification, increasing the risk of unnoticed errors.\n- **Lack of transparency and explainability**, possibly leading to a \"black box\" effect where users cannot fully understand the transformation logic.\n- **Bias propagation or amplification** embedded in AI-generated transformations.\n- **Potential data privacy and security vulnerabilities** if sensitive information is improperly handled.\n- **Risks related to provenance and version control**, where complex branching histories may obscure data origins and changes.\n- **Unequal user comprehension based on skill levels**, raising fairness and equity concerns.\n\nThese risks necessitate careful interface design, comprehensive user education, robust validation mechanisms, and transparent AI explanations to mitigate potential harms when leveraging AI for automated data transformation."

Users explore multiple alternative designs or update previous results by branching from past states. A linear log cannot represent these branches naturally.\n\n2. **Precise retrieval of relevant context:**  \n   By structuring history as data-centric threads, the system can retrieve only the relevant history (instruction, code, data) related to a particular data node or branch, avoiding confusion from unrelated conversation turns.\n\n3. **Reduce user effort in specifying follow-up tasks:**  \n   Users can specify incremental updates to previous results without re-explaining the whole context, improving ease and efficiency.\n\n4. **Improve AI model's understanding:**  \n   Tailoring the conversation history provided to the AI to only relevant parts prevents mixing unrelated contexts and improves code generation accuracy.\n\n5. **Facilitate navigation and reuse:**  \n   Users can navigate the iteration history visually with previews, and quickly find and reuse previous results, which are not feasible with linear logs.\n\n6. **Allow quick retries and incremental refinements:**  \n   Data threads enable shortcuts to rerun or modify recent instructions easily.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Specific contrast with linear conversation logs\n\n- Linear logs merge different exploration branches into one chain, losing the branching structure and context.\n- Linear logs make it hard for users to indicate which previous result to base a new design on.\n- Linear logs make it hard for AI to identify the relevant history needed for generating transformation code.\n- Linear logs force users to re-explain or re-describe the entire visualization and data transformation goal repeatedly for each iteration (frustrating and error-prone).\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n**What motivates representing iteration history as data threads instead of linear conversation logs is that data threads enable explicit representation of non-linear, branching and backtracking workflows common in iterative visualization authoring. Treating data states as first-class objects connected by user instructions allows users to precisely navigate, reuse, and specify incremental updates to previous results without restarting from scratch. This data-centric, tree-structured history facilitates accurate retrieval of relevant context for AI model code generation, prevents confusion from unrelated conversation history present in linear logs, reduces user effort, supports alternative and backtracking explorations, and enables efficient management of multiple concurrent design threads.**\n\n---\n\nThis reasoning aligns with the visual diagram showing multiple branches and the textual descriptions explaining the limitations of linear logs and benefits of data threads."

This requires a standardized way to prompt the LMM and define its actions.\n\n2. **Vision-centric and high-level planning focus:** The design aims to “simplify low-level control by providing convenient action interfaces” so the LMM focuses on high-level decision making based on visual inputs (section on Design Features of VAB).\n\n3. **Interactive Evaluation:** The agent engages in rounds, making decisions, and actions are assessed based on task success.\n\n4. **Challenges of varying input/output formats:** Given different task types and modalities (robotic interaction, GUI manipulation, CSS fixes), unifying prompts and action spaces makes the agent’s reasoning and execution consistent and tractable.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Formulate the answer based on the above reasoning\n\n**\"What motivated the use of Unified Prompts & Action Spaces across Embodied and Visual Design tasks?\"**\n\n- The motivation is to systematically handle tasks from different domains with varied input modalities and action requirements through a consistent interface.\n- This simplifies the process for the LMM agent to understand instructions and perform actions effectively across diverse scenarios.\n- It enables focusing on high-level decision-making while abstracting low-level controls.\n- Such unification facilitates benchmarking, training (e.g., behavior cloning), and generalization of the LMM as a visual foundation agent across multiple environments.\n\n---\n\n# Final Answer:\n\nThe use of **Unified Prompts & Action Spaces** across Embodied and Visual Design tasks was motivated by the need to provide a consistent and standardized interface that enables the LMM-as-Visual-Foundation-Agent to effectively perceive, reason, and act across diverse visual and interactive environments.

This abstraction allows the large multimodal model to interpret inputs and generate high-level textual action sequences uniformly across diverse target environments.

This setup enables high-level semantic information from the input image to be propagated consistently across multiple latent frames (multi-view images) via temporal attention. By attending over these embeddings within each attention block, the model effectively aligns features across views, preserving semantic identity and details throughout the multi-view latent sequence. Consequently, this integration ensures semantic consistency across all generated views in the multi-view orbital video during diffusion."

The image shows three main parts within the dashed box: the teacher-student architecture (with feature extraction and logits prediction), the preview-based learning strategy (yellow box), and the red box labeled “Category Center Contrast.”\n\nStep 2: Understand the red box “Category Center Contrast” based on the figure and context.  \n- The red box illustrates the contrastive operation between the student feature and category centers.  \n- It visualizes the student feature being attracted (green arrows) to the corresponding category centers (colored dots) and repelled (red arrows) from other category centers.  \n- These category centers correspond to the columns of the fully connected layer (weight matrix) that represent properties of each category.  \n- The loss function \\(\\mathcal{L}_{CC}\\) enforces the student network feature to be closer to its relevant category centers (both teacher’s and student’s) and farther from others.\n\nStep 3: Extract how “Category Center Contrast” operates from the textual context.  \nSection III-B3 Category Center Contrast states:  \n- The category centers are representative of specific categories. Learning discriminative category centers helps the model to classify better.  \n- The student feature \\(\\mathbf{s}_i^k\\) is guided to be similar (attracted) to its corresponding category centers \\(\\mathbf{c}_{\\hat{y}_i}^t\\) and \\(\\mathbf{c}_{\\hat{y}_i}^s\\) (teacher and student centers).  \n- Simultaneously, the student feature must be dissimilar (repelled) from non-corresponding centers \\(\\mathbf{c}_j^t\\), \\(\\mathbf{c}_j^s\\) for \\(j \\ne \\hat{y}_i\\).  \n- The contrastive loss \\(\\mathcal{L}_{CC}\\) is defined based on cosine similarity and temperature parameter. Minimizing \\(\\mathcal{L}_{CC}\\) enforces discriminative and representative features.  \n- This leads to enhanced category discrimination by explicitly guiding the student network features and category centers to be well separated according to their class.\n\nStep 4: Summarize how [mask1] leverages contrastive attract-repel operations to enhance category discrimination.  \n- The Category Center Contrast loss enforces an attract-repel mechanism whereby the student features are attracted to the category centers corresponding to their ground-truth class (from both teacher and student networks), increasing intra-class tightness.  \n- At the same time, student features are repelled from category centers of other classes, increasing inter-class separability.  \n- This dual operation sharpens the representation learned by the student network, making features more discriminative in the embedding space.  \n- It explicitly aligns student features to the semantic prototypes (category centers), thus improving classification performance and knowledge distillation.\n\nFinal answer:\n\nThe Category Center Contrast leverages contrastive attract-repel operations by attracting the student features toward their corresponding category centers from both teacher and student networks, ensuring that features cluster tightly around their true class representations. Concurrently, it repels these features from category centers of other classes, enhancing inter-class separation. This attract-repel mechanism enforced via contrastive loss leads to more discriminative and representative feature embeddings, thereby significantly improving category discrimination in the student model."

This weight scales the contribution of the Knowledge Distillation loss \\(\\mathcal{L}_{KD}\\) (and other classification-related losses) for that sample. By doing so, easier samples (with lower \\(\\gamma_i\\)) receive full weight, while harder samples are weighted less initially, allowing the student to learn from simple knowledge first and gradually preview harder knowledge, thereby enhancing the distillation process effectively."

This is the focus for the question regarding limitations on spectrum feature preservation under high noise.\n\n2. **Role of the Denoising Autoencoder (DAE):**  \n   As explained in the context, the DAE is trained to reconstruct clean spectra from noisy inputs, aiming to improve data quality by mitigating biological noise inherent in SERS spectroscopy of complex biological media (e.g., urine). The DAE is trained on noisy water-medium spectra augmented with urine background noise to learn a robust denoising function.\n\n3. **Potential Limitations of the Denoising Autoencoder:**\n\n   - **Incomplete or imperfect reconstruction of key spectral features:**  \n     The DAE attempts to remove noise but may also inadvertently smooth or remove subtle spectral features that correspond to low-concentration analytes or minor peaks, especially under *high noise conditions*. This can lead to loss or distortion of relevant signal details critical for analyte quantification.\n\n   - **Dependency on training data representativeness:**  \n     The DAE was trained on artificially generated noisy data (clean spectra + urine noise), not on patient urine samples with potentially more complex and varied noise. This may limit the DAE's ability to generalize denoising effectively in real-world situations where noise characteristics differ.\n\n   - **Risk of confounding correction with signal:**  \n     When noise characteristics resemble true signals or overlap with real spectral features, the DAE may fail to distinguish between noise and signal, potentially suppressing features that are actually meaningful or retaining noise artifacts.\n\n   - **Sensitivity to extremely high noise levels:**  \n     At very high noise levels (e.g., 20%-30% noise), the DAE's reconstruction quality may degrade, resulting in spectra where features are overly smoothed, altered, or missing, impacting downstream quantification accuracy and feature explainability.\n\n   - **Complexity and interpretability trade-off:**  \n     The internal transformation within the autoencoder is a learned latent representation, which may obscure which spectral features are preserved or lost during denoising, limiting interpretability of how specific peaks are affected.\n\n4. **Supporting evidence from the context:**\n\n   - The study notes that while the DAE substantially improved model performance in denoised spectra versus raw, certain model explanations revealed that neural networks sometimes relied on indirect predictors (presence or absence of related neurotransmitters) rather than direct serotonin peaks. This could hint that denoising was not perfect in preserving all target features under noise.\n\n   - The limitations section explicitly mentions that neural network models were not always able to “assess the association of the peaks to the target serotonin compound directly,” which indirectly implies that denoising may have caused some relevant features to be less clearly preserved or emphasized.\n\n   - Perturbation testing showed robustness up to certain noise thresholds, but did not claim flawless preservation under all noise levels.\n\n**Final answer:**  \nThe denoising autoencoder may impose limitations on spectrum feature preservation under high noise conditions by potentially smoothing or distorting subtle but important spectral features, especially those with low signal strength. Its performance depends on the representativeness of training data and may not generalize well to all real-world noise types. At very high noise levels, it might fail to fully recover key analyte signals, leading to loss of vital information necessary for accurate quantification and explainability."

This segregation ensures that user instructions and potentially malicious external data are clearly separated, allowing downstream processes (LLMs) to recognize and treat them accordingly.\n\n2. **Why is this important?**  \n   The context explains that indirect prompt injection attacks occur primarily because malicious instructions are embedded within external text. Without segregation, LLMs may be manipulated to follow injected malicious instructions. Secure Input Formatting ensures these boundaries are clearly delineated with tag-based delimiters.\n\n3. **Potential Performance Trade-Offs:**\n\n   - **Increased Prompt Complexity and Size:**  \n     Wrapping each part of the input (user instruction and external info) with additional tags increases the input length. This could lead to longer input prompts which may increase processing time or token consumption in models with limited token budgets, impacting real-time response speed.\n\n   - **Additional Parsing Overhead:**  \n     The system must parse tagged inputs to verify authenticity and segregate text sections, adding computational steps in both the preprocessing (tagging) and postprocessing stages (authentication verification).\n\n   - **Latency Due to Authentication Checks:**  \n     Because secure input formatting works hand-in-hand with authentication tags generated by cryptographic hash functions (HMAC), generating and managing these tags introduces computational overhead. While hash operations are generally fast, they still add latency compared to simpler prompt structures.\n\n   - **Potential Impact on LLM Efficiency:**  \n     LLMs must follow explicit instructions in the prompt to handle these tags properly. The increased prompt complexity may slightly affect generation efficiency or make the model's reasoning process longer, especially when chain-of-thought reasoning is used alongside.\n\n   - **Reduced Model Flexibility:**  \n     The structured format reduces the LLM’s freedom to interpret or use implicit context, possibly affecting the naturalness or creativity of some responses, though this trade-off enhances security.\n\n4. **Under Real-Time Constraints:**\n\n   Real-time applications demand fast and often resource-efficient solutions. The added steps of secure input formatting, tagging, authentication key generation, and tag-based parsing introduce computational overhead, which can:\n\n   - Increase response latency depending on the speed of the tagging and verification mechanisms.\n   - Require more resources (CPU/GPU cycles, memory) especially when integrated at scale or with many requests.\n   - Possibly reduce throughput or demand architectural optimizations to maintain real-time performance.\n\n5. **Summary:**\n\n   The trade-offs of secure input formatting hinge on **enhanced security and robustness versus added computational and latency costs**. While the approach is effective in mitigating indirect prompt injection attacks, it introduces:\n\n   - Additional prompt length and complexity\n   - Computational overhead for tag generation and verification\n   - Potential latency increases in end-to-end processing\n\n   Balancing security and responsiveness is thus a key consideration for deploying this method in real-time applications.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe primary performance trade-offs from **Secure Input Formatting** under real-time application constraints involve increased computational overhead and latency due to the added prompt complexity, tag generation, and authentication verification. This can lead to longer input prompts, additional parsing steps, and slightly slower LLM response times. While these trade-offs enhance security and robustness against indirect prompt injection attacks, they may challenge the responsiveness and scalability requirements of real-time LLM-integrated applications, necessitating careful optimization for practical deployment."

        "response": "To answer the question:  \n**\"How could integrating dynamic ML-based parsing enhance [mask1] robustness?\"**  \nwhere **[mask1]** refers to the content highlighted by the red box in the image, that is the **\"Authentication Verification\"** step, let's follow a detailed reasoning procedure based on the diagram and the provided context.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understanding [mask1] \"Authentication Verification\" from the Diagram and Context\n\n- The red-boxed area in the figure is titled \"Authentication Verification.\"  \n- This process uses **rule-based parsing** to extract and verify the authentication keys (tags) from the raw output of the LLM.  \n- The LLM outputs three sections, each delimited by authentication tags: `<TAG3>` Reasoning, `<TAG4>` Authorized (for user instructions), and `<TAG5>` Unauthorized (for external or injected instructions).  \n- The verification step validates these tags, then extracts only the content inside the `<TAG4>` Authorized section as the final output, dropping other unauthorized or malicious sections.  \n- Rule-based parsing depends on matching these fixed authentication tags and extracting the respective segment from the output.  \n- This approach is effective at segregating genuine user responses from injected malicious instructions, protecting against indirect prompt injection attacks.\n\nFrom the context:  \n- The authentication system FATH relies heavily on **dynamic hash-based tags** in formatting and verification to segregate authorized content from unauthorized content.  \n- The rule-based parsing ensures only authorized responses are retained.  \n- This strict checking has proven robust against various adaptive and optimization-based indirect prompt injection attacks.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Limitations of Current Rule-Based Parsing in Authentication Verification\n\n- Rule-based parsing functions are typically **static and rigid** — they depend on exact or well-defined tags to identify the relevant output segments.  \n- If the LLM output slightly varies, has unexpected formatting, or the attacker somehow manipulates tag appearances (e.g., by injecting confusing or malformed text), rule-based parsing might fail: either extracting wrong content or missing authorized content.  \n- Rule-based parsing can be brittle when dealing with natural language variability or noisy outputs, especially from generative models like LLMs.  \n- Hence, relying purely on rule-based parsing could have limitations in handling edge cases, malformed outputs, or subtle adaptive attacks.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: How Could Integrating Dynamic ML-Based Parsing Enhance Authentication Verification Robustness?\n\nDynamic ML-based parsing refers to applying machine learning techniques (possibly transformer-based classifiers, sequence labeling models, or semantic parsers) that can learn and adaptively identify the sections or meanings in the LLM's raw output, rather than relying solely on fixed string matches.\n\n**Advantages of integrating ML-based parsing may include:**\n\n1. **Robustness to Output Variability:**  \n   ML models can better handle slight variations, noise, or formatting changes in the LLM output that rule-based parsing might miss.\n\n2. **Semantic Understanding:**  \n   ML-based parsing can perform semantic analysis to confirm that extracted segments conceptually match authorized content, protecting against cleverly disguised malicious injections.\n\n3. **Adaptive Learning:**  \n   ML parsers can be trained or fine-tuned on a dataset of authorized and unauthorized outputs, learning subtle patterns beyond fixed tags.\n\n4. **Handling Malformed or Corrupted Tags:**  \n   Even if tags are incorrectly generated or somewhat confused due to adversarial manipulations, ML parsing could infer the right sections from context.\n\n5. **Generalization to Diverse Formats:**  \n   When authentication tags or output formatting evolve (e.g., new tags, additional information), ML parsers can adapt with less manual tweaking than fixed rule-based parsers.\n\n6. **Potential Integration of Confidence Scores:**  \n   ML parsing can provide confidence or probability estimates on the extracted segments being authorized vs unauthorized, allowing downstream systems to apply thresholds or request clarifications.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Aligning with the Paper's Context\n\n- From the paper, FATH relies on dynamic hash-based tags with structural segregation, verified by rule-based parsing.  \n- The authentication verification is the last defense line to extract a secure final answer while dropping injected content.  \n- Improving this last step with dynamic ML-based parsing will provide **greater reliability** especially under edge cases or sophisticated adaptive attacks that try to confuse the LLM output or tags.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\n**Integrating dynamic ML-based parsing into the Authentication Verification (red-boxed step) would enhance its robustness by enabling more flexible, context-aware, and error-tolerant extraction of the Authorized Response from the LLM output. Unlike rule-based parsing, which relies on strict tag matching, ML-based parsers could semantically interpret the LLM output to accurately identify genuine user instruction responses even under noisy, malformed, or adversarially manipulated tag conditions. This would improve resilience against adaptive prompt injection attacks that aim to confuse or bypass fixed parsing rules, thereby strengthening the overall security and reliability of the FATH defense system.**"

(1) Secure Input Formatting: employ dynamic tags as delimiters to distinguish user instructions from external data, providing basic identification for the role of users and LLMs;\"  \n- This tagging is part of the FATH system to ensure clear boundaries and secure segregation.  \n\nStep 3: Connect how this strengthens segregation against injection attacks  \n- The challenge with prompt injection attacks is that attackers inject malicious instructions disguised inside external info, which could manipulate the LLM to behave undesirably.  \n- Traditional methods tried tagging or adding instructions to ignore malicious content but attackers could confuse or contradict these instructions.  \n- By using **authentication tags** to wrap user instructions and external info, the system explicitly and securely segregates user instructions from external info.  \n- The tags contain a hash-based secret to verify identity or authenticity, making it difficult to counterfeit or confuse.  \n- Consequently, during output parsing, only responses corresponding to \"authorized\" tags from user instructions are accepted, unauthorized sections (malicious injections) are ignored or dropped.  \n- This reduces the risk of accidentally executing malicious instructions embedded in external info.  \n- The segregation relies on dynamic authenticated tags rather than just fixed or natural language markers, providing a cryptographically secure identifier.  \n\nStep 4: Summarizing answer  \n- Secure Input Formatting strengthens segregation against injection attacks by using dynamic, hash-based authentication tags to clearly and securely delineate user instructions from external information.  \n- This ensures that only authorized user instructions are identified and processed by the LLM, while malicious or injected content in external info is isolated and ignored.  \n- The tags provide verifiable boundaries that prevent attackers from confusing or overriding segregation rules, thereby greatly reducing vulnerability to prompt injection attacks.  \n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n[mask1], which is **Secure Input Formatting**, strengthens segregation against injection attacks by employing dynamic authentication tags as secure delimiters to clearly separate user instructions from external information. These hash-based tags provide verifiable identity markers that enable the system to authenticate authorized user instructions and isolate unauthorized or injected malicious instructions within external inputs. By explicitly marking and segregating the input roles with these secure tags, the LLM can reliably distinguish and process only authorized commands, preventing attackers from exploiting ambiguity or contradictions to override segregation—thereby effectively defending against indirect prompt injection attacks."

Or more broadly, what is the purpose or advantage of combining the multi-level vision feature enhancement (VCE + vision projector + frozen LLM etc.) with the multi-task instruction tokens in the fine-tuning stage?\n\n---\n\n### Relevant points from the context:\n\n1. **Vision Cue Enhancement (VCE):**  \n   - VCE extends feature extraction to incorporate *multi-level* vision feature maps, not only high-level features but also fine-grained local visual cues.  \n   - Specifically, it uses the high-level final feature map as the \"anchor\" and incorporates local neighboring patches from intermediate layers (reference features), via deformable cross-attention, resulting in enhanced, fine-grained visual representation.  \n   - This enriched feature is then projected as vision tokens.\n\n2. **Visual Instruction Fine-Tuning (signature part in [mask2]):**  \n   - Uses a frozen Vision Encoder and frozen LLM, only training VCE, vision projector, and Dual-LoRA adapters for efficient tuning.  \n   - Incorporates multiple downstream tasks represented by different `<taskX>` tokens ([mask1]), which means this stage explicitly involves diverse tasks.\n\n3. **Combining in visual instruction tuning:**\n   - The text tokens for different tasks ([mask1]) are concatenated with the enhanced vision tokens from VCE ([mask2]) and jointly fed into the LLM.  \n   - This supports instruction-following behavior across multiple tasks.\n\n4. **Why combine?**  \n   - VCE provides rich, fine-grained visual cues necessary to fully understand complex images.  \n   - The multi-task tokens allow the LLM to understand and respond properly based on *which task* or instruction it receives.  \n   - Together, this facilitates effective multitask learning—enabling the model to react to diverse instructions with better visual comprehension, thanks to VCE.  \n   - This combination is crucial to overcome limitations of prior works that only use high-level vision features or lack the ability to address diverse downstream tasks effectively.\n\n---\n\n### Chain of thought:\n\n- The VCE module enriches visual representations with multi-level cues, enhancing input visual tokens.  \n- The text `<taskX>` tokens represent task instructions guiding the generation of answers to specific tasks.  \n- During fine-tuning, combining these enriched visual tokens with varied task tokens allows the model to learn rich visual representations adaptable to many different tasks.  \n- This combination improves learning efficiency and accuracy because the model can attend to both detailed visual content (via VCE) and the relevant task context (via task tokens), producing suitable task-specific answers.\n\n---\n\n### Final clear direct answer:\n\nThe rationale for combining [mask1] (the set of diverse task instruction tokens) with [mask2] (the VCE-enhanced visual features and associated modules) in VCE is to enable the model to jointly leverage enriched, fine-grained visual cues alongside explicit task instructions. This fusion allows the model to better understand and respond accurately to a variety of downstream visual-language tasks during instruction fine-tuning, improving visual comprehension and mitigating limitations from relying solely on high-level visual features or single-task learning.\n\n---\n\n# **Answer:**\n\nThe rationale for combining [mask1] (multi-task instruction tokens) with [mask2] (VCE-enhanced visual features and associated modules) is to jointly leverage detailed and fine-grained visual cues provided by VCE with explicit task instructions. This integration enables the model to effectively comprehend complex visual information and adapt to diverse downstream tasks during visual instruction fine-tuning, resulting in improved task-specific accuracy and overcoming limitations of previous methods that only used high-level semantic features or single-task tuning."

Technical mechanism (from ControlNet description):\n- The ControlNet leverages the pre-trained Stable Diffusion network (denoted as SD) by incorporating additional conditions through zero-conv layers.\n- The input edge feature maps modulate the diffusion model's intermediate feature maps.\n- This conditioning via extracted edges guides the diffusion process to generate anatomically consistent and morphologically correct structures.\n\n6. Summary of the function of mask1 (Stage 2):\n- It integrates extracted edge images from segmentation masks as a conditioning signal into the SSI inpainting model.\n- By coupling the SSI model with a ControlNet pre-trained on edge conditioning, this stage controls the generation process to produce anatomically precise organs that preserve their morphology.\n- This is done efficiently without training a ControlNet from scratch, using pre-trained weights.\n- The approach overcomes limitations of using only segmentation masks and prompts by introducing explicit shape guidance in the form of edges.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n[mask1] (SSI-ControlNet Inference) integrates edge-derived features into the Surgical Stable Inpainting model by using a pre-trained ControlNet conditioned on extracted edge images from segmentation masks. These edge images provide explicit spatial guidance, allowing the diffusion process to precisely control the shape and texture of each anatomical structure during inpainting. This conditioning preserves the organ morphology by ensuring that the new organ texture is generated only within the masked region, faithfully following the edges that delineate the organ boundaries. Hence, ControlNet modulates the inpainting SSI model with edge features to maintain anatomical accuracy and coherent organ shapes in the synthesized images."

These organs are cut out from the generated images using their respective masks.\n\n2. **How the Module Works**: During this stage, these individually generated organ images are combined to form a multi-class surgical image. Each organ is extracted using its binary segmentation mask and then placed together to create a composite image containing multiple classes/organs.\n\n3. **Challenges Introduced by this Module**: The context mentions that this straightforward cut-and-paste combination leads to visual issues such as sharp edges between organs and lighting inconsistencies.\n\n4. **How these Issues are Resolved**: Because of these issues, the next stage (Stage 4) applies an image enhancement/refinement step using an SDEdit approach and an SD model trained on all organs combined. This refinement removes seams, lighting artifacts, and color mismatches.\n\n5. **Conclusion on the Role of Image Composition in Eliminating Seams and Color Mismatches**: The Image Composition stage itself does not blend the organs smoothly or eliminate visible seams and color mismatches—it simply combines the separate organ images using masks in a straightforward manner.

However, this process itself does not eliminate visible seams and color mismatches; it results in sharp edges and lighting artifacts.

The pre-trained ControlNet provides a robust mechanism to inject spatial constraints that dictate the structural shape of organs, while SSI performs organ-specific inpainting to generate detailed textures and appearances within those spatial constraints. This fusion allows precise control over anatomical organ generation by using the established spatial conditioning framework of ControlNet, enabling accurate generation of organ shapes and textures without training ControlNet from scratch.

From the provided context, SDEdit is described as an image editing method that uses stochastic differential equations (SDE) to solve the reverse diffusion process.\n\n3. The methodology section clarifies that SDEdit takes a user-given image and adds noise up to a specific limit depending on a noising strength parameter. Starting from this noisy image, the image is then denoised back to a realistic image by performing the reverse diffusion process.\n\n4. This process of adding noise and then denoising is very much in line with the noise-based editing strategies seen in earlier diffusion models, where the forward process adds noise to a clean image, and the backward process removes the noise to generate or refine images.\n\n5. The diagram (Stage 4: Image Enhancement) shows that combined images from the previous step are passed through the image refinement module which uses the SD model trained on all organs, with SDEdit applied to improve the image.\n\n6. The text explains that SDEdit allows introducing certain noise levels to enhance texture components and rectify artifacts caused during image composition like sharp edges and lighting inconsistencies.\n\n7. Therefore, SDEdit incorporates noise-based editing from earlier diffusion models by applying a controlled noising (forward diffusion) to given images and then performing reverse diffusion (denoising) starting from the corrupted image to refine and enhance the image quality.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\nSDEdit incorporates noise-based editing strategies from earlier diffusion models by first adding noise to a given image up to a specific noising strength (the forward diffusion process) and then performing the reverse diffusion process via stochastic differential equations to denoise this noisy image back into a realistic, refined image.

After providing a prompt to an LLM, its response is categorized based on whether it includes executable code (\"Response with code\") or is code-free (\"Response without code\").\n\n2. **Specialized Judges for Each Path**:\n   - *For code responses*, a \"Code Verification Judge\" evaluates whether the generated code aligns with the input instruction and is functionally correct.\n   - *For non-code responses*, a \"Safety Evaluation Judge\" assesses the response for safety adherence and ethical considerations without running any code.\n\n3. **Efficiency in Evaluation**:\n   By splitting responses into these two distinct categories, the benchmark leverages specialized evaluators optimized for their respective types of output. This means:\n   - The Code Verification Judge can focus on syntactic, semantic, and functional correctness of code, which requires interpreting and possibly simulating the code.\n   - The Safety Evaluation Judge can evaluate textual reasoning, refusals, or safe alternative instructions without going through complex code testing.\n\n4. **Simulation Usage**:\n   Furthermore, for code responses deemed valid by the judges, simulation testing in a physical environment (AirSim) follows to detect collision risks and other safety issues. Responses without code do not require this step, reducing computational overhead.\n\n5. **Optimization of Efficiency**:\n   This division reduces unnecessary computations:\n   - Non-code responses avoid costly code execution and simulation.\n   - Only code responses undergo thorough code verification and simulation.\n   \n6. **Overall Benefit**:\n   Categorizing responses into \"code\" vs. \"non-code\" streamlines the evaluation workflow by applying targeted assessments tailored to the nature of the response, thus optimizing resource use, speeding up evaluation, and ensuring accuracy in judging safety and correctness.\n\n**Final Answer**:  \nCategorizing LLM responses into \"Response with code\" versus \"Response without code\" optimizes evaluation process efficiency by enabling the use of specialized AI judges tailored to the nature of the output—Code Verification Judge for code responses and Safety Evaluation Judge for non-code responses.

Because convolutional layers only see local neighborhoods, they can’t capture global context and long-range dependencies.  \n- This limited receptive field results in overly smooth back normal maps and less detailed geometry on the back.\n\n**Step 3: What does the paper propose to solve back detail smoothness?**  \n- Introduce Spatial Transformer (S-Trans) that uses a self-attention mechanism to gather global context from the entire normal map or input, which helps infer invisible back details better.  \n- This approach better captures correlations across spatially distant regions, overcoming the locality limitation of CNNs.\n\n**Step 4: The question asks about alternative methods beyond [mask1] (the Spatial Transformer) to address back detail smoothness**  \n- The text mentions that before the transformer approach, some previous methods tried predicting back normal maps with specialized networks (usually residual ConvNets). But those were limited.  \n- Another method cited is ECON [14] which uses MRF loss to propagate local and global information, helping to incorporate clues from image regions to guide back normal prediction. This is a regularization or loss design strategy that augments network learning with priors about spatial smoothness and consistency.  \n- Also mentioned in context are methods [15-17] using normal maps as intermediate representations to delegate the task of back detail prediction to a dedicated network, effectively decoupling the complex problem.\n\n**Step 5: Drawing from general domain knowledge (within scope of context)**  \n- Other potential alternatives (not necessarily in this text but logically consistent) include:  \n  - Using generative models or adversarial training to hallucinate back details learned from large data priors.  \n  - Using multi-view or temporal data to infer back details from multiple images or time steps, though temporal modeling is addressed separately by the Temporal Transformer (T-Trans) in this work.  \n  - Utilizing parametric or statistical models of human shape and appearance as priors constraining back detail plausibility.  \n\nBut the question asks specifically about methods beyond the Spatial Transformer, probably from the provided context.\n\n**Summary of alternative methods from the text:**  \n- Residual convolutional networks for normal map prediction [15,16,17] (the method Spatial Transformer aims to improve upon).  \n- Use of MRF loss to propagate global and local information for back normals (ECON [14]).  \n- Delegating back detail prediction task to a specialized normal map prediction network (normal maps as a proxy).  \n\n**Final answer**\n\n---\n\n### Alternative methods to address back detail smoothness beyond the Spatial Transformer (highlighted by the red box), as per the context, include:\n\n- Using **residual convolutional networks** to predict back normal maps from images or front normal maps, which focus on local detail but lack global awareness and thus lead to some smoothing.  \n- Employing **Markov Random Field (MRF) loss-based regularization** (like in ECON) to propagate both local and global constraints, enhancing the predicted back normal maps by encouraging spatial consistency and incorporating some form of global context without transformers.  \n- Utilizing **normal maps as intermediate representations** with specialized prediction networks, effectively delegating the back detail reconstruction to a proxy network trained explicitly for that task.\n\nThese methods attempt to improve back detail smoothness but remain limited by the lack of long-range dependency modeling that the Spatial Transformer addresses.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If the question expects techniques beyond the paper’s own method and cited works, no further alternatives are explicitly mentioned in the provided text. Therefore, the above methods represent the key alternatives referenced."

These joint tokens guide the network to establish correspondences between joints across adjacent frames.\n\n- The textual context states:  \n  - \"Joint Tokens. The transformer decoder aims to map high-level spatiotemporal features from the encoder to instance-level temporal features.\"  \n  - \"To enable the network to learn human body correspondence across frames, the Transformer decoder incorporates joint tokens to regress the joint position of each frame.\"  \n  - \"The output joint positions serve as a supervisory signal for the network.\"\n\n- Thus, [mask1] corresponds to **Joint Tokens representing human body joints used as guidance in temporal correspondence learning**.\n\n---\n\n**Understanding Ethical Concerns Potentially Associated With Using Joint Tokens for Temporal Correspondence Learning:**\n\n1. **Nature of Joint Tokens:**\n   - Joint tokens represent **human skeletal joint positions** extracted (or inferred) from video frames.\n   - These are highly sensitive biometric identifiers because they represent detailed human pose and movement data.\n\n2. **Potential Ethical Issues:**\n\n   - **Privacy Concerns:**  \n     Use of joint tokens entails collecting and processing detailed human pose data. If this data can be linked to individuals (through re-identification or other means), there is a risk of infringing individual privacy, particularly in video surveillance or uncontrolled environments.\n\n   - **Consent and Data Usage:**  \n     The creation and use of such detailed biometric data might be done without full informed consent, raising ethical questions about individuals' autonomy and rights over their own bodily data.\n\n   - **Misuse or Dual Use:**  \n     Detailed temporal representations of human motion can be misused — for surveillance, tracking, behavior profiling, or unauthorized monitoring.\n\n   - **Bias and Fairness:**  \n     The joint token extraction relies on pose estimation models (e.g., SMPL, PyMAF).

        "response": "The [mask1] in the question refers to the component highlighted by a red box in Figure 2, labeled as \"Stage 3: Confidence Scoring.\" This component includes the \"Confidence Scoring function\" that evaluates the quality of synthetic image editing samples, providing a confidence score (λ) based on semantic consistency and perceptual quality.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Role of the Confidence Scoring Function (Stage 3):**  \n   Stage 3 uses a large multimodal model (such as GPT-4o, distilled into InternVL2) to automatically assign quality confidence scores to generated editing samples. These scores reflect how well the edited images align with the instruction (semantic consistency) and their visual quality (perceptual quality). Only high-confidence samples are retained for training in Stage 4 (\"Learning a Generalist\").\n\n2. **Purpose of Importance Weighting:**  \n   The importance weighting function, indexed by confidence score λ, adjusts the loss contribution of each sample during model training. Samples with higher scores are assigned higher weights, while low-quality or poorly aligned samples get down-weighted or filtered out. This data quality control helps to reduce bias by emphasizing reliable, high-quality examples.\n\n3. **Limitations of Using a Single Confidence Scoring Method:**  \n   The current confidence scoring relies on a specific large multimodal model distilled into InternVL2. While effective, any single scoring function may have its own biases or errors in evaluating certain tasks, contexts, or subtle editing nuances. These biases might lead to skewed selection or uneven representation of sample types, causing an imbalance in training data.\n\n4. **How Alternative Weighting Strategies Could Complement the Confidence Scoring Function:**  \n   - **Diverse Scoring Metrics:** Employing multiple quality metrics (e.g., perceptual, semantic, user preference, adversarial detection) can provide a more holistic evaluation of sample quality. Combining them can mitigate individual metric biases.  \n   - **Ensemble Weighting:** Utilizing an ensemble of different LMMs or scoring models to assign consensus or averaged weights could improve robustness, ensuring no single model’s bias dominates.  \n   - **Task-Specific Weighting:** Different editing tasks may benefit from tailored weighting schemes. For example, some tasks may require stronger emphasis on semantic consistency, others on visual realism. Adaptive weighting per task would balance representation.  \n   - **Dynamic or Curriculum-based Weighting:** Adjusting weights based on model learning progress (e.g., initially focus on easier high-confidence samples, then gradually include more diverse or borderline samples) could reduce bias by exposing the model to a wider variety of data over time.  \n   - **Human-in-the-loop Feedback:** Incorporating periodic human review or annotation to recalibrate weighting functions ensures that the automated confidence scores remain aligned with human quality standards, reducing bias from purely automated metrics.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAlternative weighting strategies, such as incorporating multiple complementary metrics, ensemble scoring, task-aware adaptive weighting, and curriculum learning, can complement the existing confidence scoring to better represent the true quality and diversity of training samples. These approaches reduce bias inherent in selecting samples solely based on a single automated confidence score, resulting in a more balanced and effective training dataset for the image editing model Omni-Edit."

To overcome these challenges, the paper introduces the idea of learning a generalist model, Omni-Edit, that can perform diverse editing tasks.\n\n4. Instead of relying on a single unified expert model, the authors propose leveraging supervision from multiple specialist models, each expert in a specific type of editing task. This is the \"specialist-to-generalist supervision\" approach.\n\n5.

Each FRCAB performs frequency-domain processing that extracts and enhances inter-channel statistics of feature amplitude and phase, focusing on high-frequency signals (edges and details) through a residual-in-residual architecture. This design enables progressive refinement of feature maps, ensuring that high-frequency components critical for precise saliency detection are enhanced and consistently propagated as the decoder upsamples and combines multi-level features. The pipeline is further guided by ground truth supervision and a co-focus frequency loss in the frequency domain, which enforces emphasis on difficult high-frequency signals, thus improving frequency feature consistency and reliability throughout the decoding process.\n\n---\n\n**Thus, the EFPD leverages frequency-domain attention and residual structures to emphasize and preserve high-frequency signals during its top-down feature fusion and up-sampling operations.**"

The lower resolution edge feature \\(e_2\\) is then up-sampled to match the higher resolution \\(e_1\\). Following this, \\(e_1\\) and the up-sampled \\(e_2\\) are concatenated along the channel dimension to combine complementary edge information from different feature levels. This concatenated feature is refined and further up-sampled by a convolutional block (DU), producing a fused and enhanced edge feature \\(e_3\\). This hierarchical combination of up-sampling, concatenation, and refinement enables FEM to deliver clear, multi-scale edge features that guide the decoder for accurate boundary prediction.\n\n---\n\nThis leverages both the figure and the detailed textual descriptions in Section III-B and the figure caption, answering the question accurately and completely."

Extracting reliable and structured facts about entities from Wikidata (Step 1) provides a foundation of factual triples, including subjects, relations, and objects, from which conflicting claims can be derived.\n\n2. In the context of constructing knowledge conflicts (Step 2 in the figure and text), entity substitution strategies for conflict claim generation depend on the extracted data. Specifically, substitutions are done by replacing the object or sometimes the subject in the extracted triples with another same-type entity to simulate misinformation, temporal, or semantic conflicts.\n\n3. The text explicitly states that based on the extracted knowledge triples (from Step 1), substitutions occur with \"a same-type entity\" to create conflicts. For misinformation conflicts, the object in the triple is substituted with a false one; for temporal conflicts, time information is appended; for semantic conflicts, additional descriptions are added to simulate ambiguity.\n\n4. Therefore, the quality and structure of the extracted facts determine how substitutions can be made effectively to generate meaningful and realistic conflict claims. In other words, the extraction step provides the factual knowledge triples that are the input on which substitution operations are performed.\n\nIn conclusion, extracting facts from Wikidata (Step 1) influences entity substitution strategies by providing the base factual knowledge triples that are then modified by substituting entities of the same type to construct different types of knowledge conflict claims, such as misinformation, temporal, and semantic conflicts. This extraction ensures that substitutions are semantically valid (same-type entities) and meaningful for conflict simulation."

The boxed content shows a component named \"Text2Param\" (Text to Parameter), surrounded by four example tool functions with example JSON parameters:  \n- \"retrieve_content\": with keys \"query\" and \"n_chunks\" for RAG database retrieval  \n- \"get_company_news\"  \n- \"get_stock_price\"  \n- \"get_reddit_post\"\n\nWithin the red box, there is also a smaller inset labeled \"Preprocessed RAG Database\" built from chunked and vectorized SEC filings.\n\nStep 2: Understand the relevant text in the context regarding the RAG & Tool Functions highlighted in red  \nSection 3.2 (\"Unified RAG & Function Calling\") describes:  \n- Agents can invoke various tools automatically using Text2Param capability of the underlying LLM, including retrieving data from RAG.  \n- The retrieval of chunks from financial reports (which are long and complex) is encapsulated into a tool function, \"retrieve_content.\"  \n- This tool function allows the agent itself to write its own query and specify the number of chunks to retrieve (\"n_chunks\").  \n- If the retrieved chunks are insufficient, agents can refine the retrieval parameters (query or chunk number) and request another retrieval round.  \n- This dynamic adjustment means the parameters are adapted by the agent based on task needs, enabling iterative retrieval.  \n- This design integrates RAG retrieval into the unified tool-calling framework, making the agent’s capabilities clearer and manageable.\n\nStep 3: Summarize how \"retrieve_content\" is leveraged to adapt retrieval parameters dynamically  \n- The \"retrieve_content\" tool function encapsulates RAG query mechanism.  \n- Agents use Text2Param to generate the parameters for \"retrieve_content\" themselves.  \n- Based on the initial retrieval results, agents analyze whether the information is adequate.  \n- If not, agents modify the parameters—such as refining the \"query\" string to be more targeted or changing \"n_chunks\" to retrieve more or fewer chunks.  \n- These updated parameters are then applied in subsequent calls to \"retrieve_content,\" forming a feedback loop and adaptive retrieval process without manual intervention.\n\nFinal Answer:  \nThe \"[mask1]\" component—Text2Param with the \"retrieve_content\" tool—enables agents to autonomously generate and adjust retrieval parameters dynamically by writing their own queries and specifying the number of document chunks to fetch from the preprocessed RAG database. If the retrieved information is insufficient for their analytical needs, agents iteratively refine the \"query\" and \"n_chunks\" parameters and perform additional retrievals. This dynamic parameter adaptation, mediated through Text2Param, allows agents to tailor the retrieval process to the evolving task requirements within a unified framework alongside other tool functions.\n\n# Short Answer\n\n[mask1] refers to the Text2Param component with the “retrieve_content” tool function that enables agents to autonomously generate and adjust retrieval parameters dynamically. Agents formulate their own retrieval queries and specify the number of chunks (“n_chunks”) to fetch from the preprocessed RAG database. If the retrieved chunks are insufficient, agents can iteratively refine these parameters—modifying the query or chunk number—and perform subsequent retrievals. This mechanism leverages Text2Param to adaptively tailor the retrieval process to task needs, integrating RAG functionality into a unified tool-calling framework for flexible and effective information access."

In the dual-agent setup, agents are required to ask for advice from each other, inspect and critique each other’s analyses, and reach a consensus before providing the final response. This adjustment prevents one agent from dominating the task and ensures interactive collaboration, in contrast to the single-agent case where the agent operates independently without any forced communication."

an estimation of how to \"transport\" or align the old classifiers within the new embedding space guided by semantic similarity.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify the blue box content ([mask2])\n\nThe blue box is enclosing the **Classifier Consolidation** area in the figure, which includes the following main components:\n\n- The old domain and new domain classifiers.\n- \\( PTM \\phi_0 \\) (Pre-trained model used as initialization).\n- The transportation cost matrix \\( Q \\) (the red box).\n- The process of aligning classifiers from old domains to new domains guided by semantic similarity.\n- The overall classifier consolidation method involving retraining new classifiers and transporting old classifiers using class-wise semantic information.\n\nThus, **[mask2] = Classifier Consolidation process** (the overall scheme of transfers, retraining, aligning classifier weights across domains using semantic-guided optimal transport).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Understanding the bias problem in [mask1] estimation\n\nFrom the context under \"Classifier Consolidation\" and \"Old Classifier Transport\":\n\n- There's a mismatch between old classifiers and the newly consolidated embedding space due to data evolving over different domains.\n- We cannot store old data (exemplar-free setting), so there's no direct way to retrain or recalibrate old classifiers with actual old data.\n- Therefore, the estimation of the transformation or transportation cost matrix \\( Q \\) can be biased because it is indirectly calculated, relying on semantic information extracted from class centers in the embedding space of the pre-trained model.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: What alternative could mitigate biases in [mask1] (Transportation Cost) for semantic-guided [mask2] (Classifier Consolidation)?\n\nThe question asks for an alternative method or approach that could mitigate biases in this estimation. \n\nIn the context, the transportation cost \\( Q \\) is constructed based on:\n\n- Semantic similarity between class centers across tasks, i.e., the Euclidean distances of class centers extracted by the pre-trained model.\n- Uniform marginals for class weights (importance).\n- Usage of Optimal Transport (OT) to find the minimal cost alignment.\n\n**Potential bias sources:**\n\n- Semantic similarity estimation relies on pre-trained model features, which might not perfectly represent domain gaps.\n- Uniform weight assumptions might not reflect class importance accurately.\n- No direct access to old domain data to calibrate or refine the cost.\n\n---\n\n### Looking for discussion of alternatives or improvements\n\nFrom the context, is any alternative explicitly mentioned?\n\n- The text references using **class centers** extracted via the current backbone \\( \\phi_0 \\) to approximate semantic similarity.\n- Also, the use of uniform distribution for weighting \\( u \\) and \\( v \\).\n  \nThere is no direct mention of an alternative method or improved approach for mitigating bias in transportation cost \\( Q \\) estimation.\n\nHowever, similar methods in literature or future work could:\n\n- Use **task similarity weighting** to refine \\( Q \\) (as done in the Representation Consolidation step).\n- Employ learned metrics or adaptive weighting instead of uniform \\( u, v \\).\n- Use additional metadata if available (not feasible here).\n- Collect or replay some exemplars to better estimate cost (but exemplar-free setting forbids this).\n\nBut none of these alternatives are stated explicitly here.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The **Transportation Cost matrix** \\( Q \\) estimation uses semantic similarity via class centers in the embedding space.\n- This **estimation may incur biases** due to indirect measurement and exemplar-free restrictions.\n- The **Classifier Consolidation** uses semantic-guided optimal transport to align old classifiers to the unified embedding.\n- No **explicit alternative method** to mitigate these biases is presented in the given text.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n**The alternative to mitigate biases in transportation cost estimation for semantic-guided classifier consolidation is not explicitly discussed or proposed in the given context.**\n\nHence, based on the provided information:\n\n# Final Answer:\n\n**Unanswerable**"

It is a matrix with entries \\( Q_{i,j} \\) representing cost values between classes in old and new domains.\n\n2. **Determine the role of this Transportation Cost \\( Q \\) as per the text:**\n\n   From the context under \"Classifier Consolidation,\" the old classifier and new classifier need to be aligned because the embedding space has changed due to consolidation.\n\n   The key challenge is that:\n   - Old classifiers are incompatible with the new unified embedding.\n   - There is no exemplar memory of old data (exemplar-free setting).\n   - So, the old classifier needs to be \"transported\" or recalibrated using semantic information.\n\n3. **How is this transportation or transformation done?**\n\n   - The transformation function \\( g(\\cdot) \\) is implemented via optimal transport.\n   - Matrix \\( Q \\) encodes the transportation cost between classes across old and new domains.\n   - Larger values in \\( Q \\) mean a higher cost to transport or reuse one classifier component for another class.\n   - The optimal transport problem minimizes total transportation cost from the old to new classifier.\n\n4. **How is \\( Q \\) defined?**\n\n   - \\( Q_{i,j} \\) is defined as the Euclidean distance between class centers in the pre-trained embedding space.\n   - These class centers reflect semantic proximity between classes.\n   - Smaller distances (less cost) indicate that classes are semantically similar and more willing to transport classifier weights.\n\n5. **Why use \\( Q \\) to guide old classifier transport?**\n\n   - Because it provides a measure of semantic similarity between classes of old and new domains.\n   - This guides the optimal transport plan to re-weight and realign the old classifier's weights based on semantically related classes in the new classifier.\n   - This helps to maintain performance on old domain classes without requiring old data.\n\n6. **Summary:**\n\n   The transportation cost matrix \\( Q \\) reflects semantic distances between classes. It is used to solve the optimal transport problem that finds the cheapest and most semantically consistent way to transform the new classifier into an aligned version of the old classifier, thus guiding the old classifier transport to resist forgetting while respecting class-level semantic relationships.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\nThe rationale for using the transportation cost matrix \\( Q \\) ([mask1]) to guide old classifier transport is that \\( Q \\) encodes the semantic similarity (measured as the Euclidean distance between class centers in the pre-trained embedding space) between classes of old and new domains. This semantic information allows the optimal transport formulation to find the minimal-cost mapping that reuses and realigns the weights of the new classifier to approximate the old classifier in a way that preserves semantic relationships. By doing so, \\( Q \\) guides the recalibration of the old classifier to be compatible with the consolidated embedding space without requiring access to old domain data, thereby effectively mitigating forgetting in domain-incremental learning."

These methods rely on predefined part labels and have limited scalability to large and diverse 3D datasets.\n\n2. **Challenges with previous methods:**\n\n   - Dependence on part label sets as text prompts makes scaling to large datasets like Objaverse difficult.\n   - The supervisory signals from VLMs restrict flexibility and cannot handle ambiguous or fine-grained segmentation.\n   - The 2D features used can be low-resolution or lack detail for accurate feature transfer.\n\n3. **Proposed innovation in SAMPart3D (as described in the context and Figure 2 (a)):**\n\n   - Instead of VLMs, **DINOv2** is used as a **text-independent**, self-supervised **2D visual feature extractor**. This eliminates reliance on textual part labels, enhancing flexibility and scalability.\n\n   - **FeatUp** technique is employed to upsample and refine the low-resolution DINOv2 features, making them more suitable as 2D supervisory signals for 3D feature learning.\n\n4. **Distilling DINOv2 features into PTv3-object:**\n\n   - PTv3-object is a **modified version of the PTv3 backbone** tailored specifically for 3D object point clouds (instead of large scene point clouds). It preserves more detail by removing down-sampling layers and stacking more transformer blocks.\n\n   - During training, 3D point clouds are input to PTv3-object, and multi-view RGB images of these objects are rendered.\n\n   - The multi-view images are passed through DINOv2 (via FeatUp), producing dense, detailed 2D features.\n\n   - Using known mappings between 3D points and pixels, these rich 2D features supervise the training of the 3D backbone features, via mean squared error loss after handling occlusion using depth ordering.\n\n5. **How does this reshape prior methodologies?**\n\n   - **Text-independence and Model-agnosticism:** By distilling DINOv2 features rather than VLM outputs, the framework avoids dependence on semantic part labels and textual prompts, enabling open-world zero-shot segmentation over large unlabeled 3D datasets.\n\n   - **Better feature quality for supervision:** Use of FeatUp-refined DINOv2 features provides higher-quality, low-level visual features (color, texture, boundary cues) as supervision, helpful for part segmentation.\n\n   - **Tailored 3D backbone:** PTv3-object modification, focused on detail preservation and feature abstraction suitable for object-scale point clouds.\n\n   - **Scalability:** The method can scale to large datasets like Objaverse, which was infeasible for previous VLM-based distillations.\n\n---\n\n### Final concise answer:\n\nDistilling **DINOv2** features (red box) into the **PTv3-object** backbone (blue box) reshapes standard 2D-to-3D distillation methodologies by replacing reliance on text-dependent vision-language models with rich, text-independent 2D visual features. This eliminates the need for predefined part label sets, enabling scalable learning of 3D backbone features from large-scale unlabeled 3D datasets. The use of FeatUp-refined DINOv2 features enhances supervisory detail, while the tailored PTv3-object architecture preserves detailed 3D object features. Together, this approach enables flexible, scalable, and fine-grained 3D feature learning that supports zero-shot 3D part segmentation on diverse datasets, overcoming the limitations of previous methods reliant on textual prompts and limited 3D annotations."

According to the text and figure, this corresponds to the **scale-conditioned lightweight MLP** trained in the sample-specific fine-tuning stage to perform grouping for segmentation-aware features conditioned on scale.\n\n- [mask2] is the content highlighted by the blue box in figure part (b), labeled as \"Masks\". According to the text, these are the **2D segmentation masks generated by SAM (Segment Anything Model)** for the multi-view renderings of 3D objects.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Conventional grouping strategies:**  \n   - Usually, 3D point cloud segmentation groups points based on geometric or feature similarity without conditioning on external scale or multi-view information.  \n   - Often, grouping or clustering is done purely in feature space or based on simple distance metrics.\n\n2. **What is introduced here?**  \n   - The framework first obtains 2D segmentation masks from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) on multi-view rendered images of the 3D object. These 2D masks provide rich, spatially consistent segmentation cues.  \n   - These 2D masks are then mapped back to 3D points via known mapping (since each 3D point corresponds to pixel(s) in multiple views).  \n   - For each mask, a 3D **scale value** is computed (standard deviation of coordinate distributions) which controls the **granularity** of segmentation (multi-scale grouping).\n\n3. **Scale-conditioned MLP (red box):**  \n   - A lightweight MLP model is trained **to group 3D points conditioned on this scale**, i.e., it can adapt the segmentation granularity according to the scale input.  \n   - It uses contrastive learning over sampled point pairs from the masked areas to learn segmentation-aware features.  \n   - The MLP leverages not only the pre-trained backbone’s 3D features but also the low-level features from a skip connection (normals, color, coordinates).  \n   - This contrasts with conventional grouping which is usually unconditional or fixed-scale.\n\n4. **Use of 2D Masks (blue box):**  \n   - The 2D masks from SAM provide semantic segmentation cues derived from images (multi-view) which are rich and accurate.  \n   - Instead of grouping solely based on 3D geometry/features, the approach distills the masks into scale-aware supervision signals to guide grouping in 3D.  \n   - By incorporating these masks, the grouping becomes **segmentation-aware** and **scale-controllable** rather than relying on unsupervised geometric grouping.\n\n5. **Summary:**  \n   The scale-conditioned MLP [mask1] leverages the 2D segmentation masks [mask2] beyond conventional grouping strategies by integrating semantic segmentation signals from SAM masks into the grouping process and learning to produce segmentation-aware 3D features conditioned on scale, enabling multi-granularity part segmentation that is consistent with multi-view semantic cues. This allows dynamic control of granularity and improved segmentation quality, which conventional grouping methods based solely on geometric or fixed-scale criteria cannot achieve.\n\n# Final answer:\n\nThe scale-conditioned MLP (red box) leverages the 2D segmentation masks from SAM (blue box) by using these masks as supervision to train the MLP to produce segmentation-aware 3D features conditioned on scale. This enables multi-granularity grouping that dynamically adjusts segmentation granularity based on scale input, incorporating rich semantic cues from multi-view 2D masks. Unlike conventional grouping strategies that rely solely on geometric or feature similarity at a fixed scale, this approach distills 2D mask information into the 3D grouping process to achieve more accurate, scale-controllable, and semantically meaningful part segmentation."

This multiplicity enables a more comprehensive and less biased evaluation of the local LLM’s capabilities, resulting in more trustworthy and stable performance metrics.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe **Batch Inference** stage influences the robustness measured during Evaluation by generating a batch of diverse responses for each test prompt. This multiplicity of outputs allows for a more comprehensive assessment by the Evaluator (service LLMs), reducing bias and improving the reliability and robustness of the performance metrics. Consequently, it helps capture the variability and capability of the local LLM more effectively, leading to a more trustworthy evaluation on test prompts."

        "response": "The [mask1] in the question corresponds to the \"ShuffleAttn\" module highlighted by the red box in the image. To understand how ShuffleAttn leverages channel mixing principles compared to Squeeze-and-Excitation’s (SE) recalibration, let's analyze the information extracted from the diagram and the context.\n\n### Step 1: Identify and describe the two modules:\n\n- **ShuffleAttn (Shuffle Attention):**  \n  Located in the Single-Frame High-Resolution Branch and shown in the detailed zoom of that branch, ShuffleAttn is combined with a convolution (Conv) block. The naming \"Shuffle\" suggests a method inspired by channel shuffling techniques, which typically aim to mix information across channels efficiently. This allows the model to perform inter-channel communication by rearranging (shuffling) channels and applying attention mechanisms, providing effective channel mixing while being computationally efficient.\n\n- **Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE):**  \n  Located in the Dual-Branch Feature Decoder, SE is known as a recalibration method that explicitly models channel-wise relationships by squeezing spatial dimensions via global average pooling and learning channel-wise importance through fully connected layers followed by sigmoid activations. It selectively emphasizes or suppresses feature channels, which enhances the quality of feature representations by adaptively recalibrating channel responses.\n\n### Step 2: Channel mixing principles:\n\n- **ShuffleAttn:**  \n  Leveraging \"shuffle\" operations means ShuffleAttn rearranges channels to enable better cross-channel communication and mixing. This is a direct and efficient approach to redistribute information across feature channels, potentially improving feature extraction and representation without heavy computation or extra parameters. Shuffle operations combined with attention focus on correlating and mixing channel features effectively.\n\n- **Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE):**  \n  SE recalibrates channel-wise features by modeling channel dependencies in a global context and uses learned scaling factors to weigh channels adaptively. This is more of a gating mechanism, where the excitation step applies learned weights to each channel, enhancing or diminishing features selectively based on learned importance. SE focuses on weighting channels rather than rearranging or mixing features across them.\n\n### Step 3: Key differences:\n\n- ShuffleAttn **actively mixes channels** by shuffling and attention mechanisms, emphasizing inter-channel communication through rearrangement and convolution.\n- SE **passively recalibrates channels** by scaling feature maps channel-wise according to learned importance scores, based on global context, but it does not shuffle or mix information across channels.\n\n### Final reasoning and answer:\n\nThe ShuffleAttn module leverages channel mixing principles by rearranging (shuffling) channels to enable effective cross-channel communication and mixing of features, combined with convolutions and attention mechanisms. This differs from Squeeze-and-Excitation’s recalibration approach, which models channel importance globally and applies adaptive scaling to recalibrate channels without mixing or rearranging them. Therefore, ShuffleAttn achieves channel mixing via shuffling and integration, while SE achieves channel recalibration via adaptive gating based on learned channel significance.\n\n---\n\n### **Answer:**\n\nShuffleAttn leverages channel mixing principles by actively shuffling channels to facilitate cross-channel communication and integration, enabling efficient mixing of feature information across channels. This shuffling, combined with convolutional and attention mechanisms, allows the model to blend channel features effectively. In contrast, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) performs channel recalibration by globally pooling spatial information and applying learned scaling factors to emphasize or suppress channels without rearranging them. Thus, ShuffleAttn mixes and redistributes channel features through shuffling, while SE selectively reweights channels based on learned importance to recalibrate feature responses."

The top K scores guide the selective cross-attention calculation, effectively focusing on salient regions and reducing computational overhead on non-salient (redundant) areas.\n\nThus, SCAM **implements cross-attention weighting** to fuse features from low- and high-resolution branches selectively.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the function of SWF (Saliency-Weighted Feature Module)**  \nAccording to the text and the diagram:  \n- SWF uses the saliency mask generated from the low-resolution branch (multi-frame features) to explicitly enhance the saliency features in the high-resolution branch.  \n- In the diagram's inset for the SWF Module, the features from the high-resolution branch \\(F_T\\) are modulated (element-wise multiplied and added) by the features \\(F_E\\) weighted or masked by saliency information. This enforces the high-resolution features to emphasize salient regions highlighted by the low-res branch.   \n\n**Step 4: How does SWF extend SCAM's cross-attention weighting?**  \n- SCAM performs selective cross-attention weighting to guide which regions of the high-resolution features to focus on based on the low-resolution features. It acts as a filter or selection mechanism.  \n- SWF builds upon this by **explicitly enhancing the saliency features in the high-resolution branch** using the saliency mask derived from low-resolution features, effectively reinforcing and amplifying the attention weighting introduced by SCAM.  \n- Therefore, SWF extends SCAM’s cross-attention by **applying saliency-weighted feature modulation**: after SCAM filters relevant features, SWF uses the saliency mask to reweight or amplify these features, enabling better fusion and feature enhancement before decoding.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\nThe **Saliency-Weighted Feature Module (SWF)** (highlighted by the red box) extends the **Selective Cross Attention Module (SCAM)**’s (blue box) cross-attention weighting by explicitly enhancing the saliency features in the high-resolution branch. While SCAM computes selective cross-attention to guide feature fusion between low- and high-resolution representations by selecting salient regions, SWF uses the saliency mask generated from the low-resolution branch to modulate and amplify the high-resolution features accordingly. This saliency-weighted modulation reinforces the attentive fusion, allowing more effective integration of multi-resolution features before further decoding."

Rotation noise (RN): perturb the torsion angles of rotatable bonds.\n  - Vibration and rotation noise (VRN): perturb bond lengths, bond angles, torsion angles (including rotatable bonds).\n  \n  These noises affect internal molecular degrees of freedom that correspond to physically meaningful conformational changes (flexible rotations and vibrations).\n\n- The **blue box** displays the coordinate Gaussian noise (CGN), which applies Gaussian noise directly on atomic Cartesian coordinates, serving as more traditional \"coordinate denoising.\"\n\n### Step 2: Relation to the **hybrid noise** and Frad framework\n\n- The hybrid noise is formed by applying **CAN** first (chemical-aware, in internal coordinate space) and then applying **CGN** (Gaussian noise on Cartesian coordinates).\n- This hybrid noise leads to noisy conformations \\(x_{fin}\\), from which the model learns to predict the CGN component \\(\\Delta x\\).\n\n### Step 3: Theoretical equivalence to atomic force learning\n\nFrom the context (Section 2.1.1 Atomic forces learning interpretation):\n\n- The authors establish a theorem that **fractional denoising with hybrid noise (CAN + CGN) is equivalent to learning atomic forces** of an approximate molecular distribution modeled by the Boltzmann distribution.\n- The distribution of the hybrid noise must satisfy: the added noise after CAN is Gaussian (CGN), which is a key condition for equivalence.\n- The molecular distribution is approximated using a **mixture model** weighted by equilibrium conformations plus hybrid noise, modeling real conformational changes better than pure Cartesian noise.\n\nThis allows:\n\n- The denoising process to match the gradient (score) of the molecular conformation distribution, which is proportional to the atomic forces.\n- CAN provides more realistic sampling of molecular conformational space (rotations and vibrations) beyond small Cartesian perturbations.\n- CGN ensures minimal assumptions for mathematical equivalence with force learning.\n\n### Step 4: How the hybrid noise enables **Frad’s equivalent force learning**\n\n- CAN captures the **true molecular distribution better** by modeling rotations and vibrations (important physical motions) not effectively covered by pure coordinate noise.\n- CGN guarantees the **mathematical condition** for equivalence: the denoiser learns to predict Gaussian noise, which corresponds to learning the force field as gradient of log probability of conformations.\n- The joint application of CAN followed by CGN:\n\n  - **Effectively expands the support of sampling away from equilibrium conformations**, covering broader and more realistic conformational changes.\n  - **Improves the precision of force targets** because perturbations reflect both internal structural changes and coordinate uncertainty.\n  - Thus, the equivalent force learning interpretation applies, but for a more physically accurate **approximate molecular distribution**.\n\n### Summary answer:\n\nThe **hybrid noise** composed of **chemical-aware noise (CAN)**—which models physically meaningful conformational changes such as rotations and vibrations of molecular internal coordinates—and **coordinate Gaussian noise (CGN)**—which adds isotropic Gaussian perturbations in Cartesian coordinates—enables Frad’s equivalent force learning interpretation by:\n\n- Allowing the noisy molecular conformations to better approximate the true molecular conformation distribution (including both rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom),\n- While the CGN component ensures that the denoising task corresponds to learning the gradient of the log-probability (score function) of this approximate distribution,\n- Which is mathematically equivalent to learning the atomic forces governing the molecule,\n- Hence, hybrid noise provides both a realistic distribution landscape and necessary mathematical conditions for Frad’s fractional denoising to be interpreted as equivalent force learning.\n\n---\n\n**Final concise answer:**\n\nThe hybrid noise combines **chemical-aware noise (CAN)** (red box) that models realistic molecular conformational changes via rotation and vibration perturbations, with **coordinate Gaussian noise (CGN)** (blue box) that adds Gaussian noise in Cartesian coordinates. This combination enables Frad to approximate the true molecular distribution more accurately and meet the mathematical condition requiring Gaussian noise for equivalence. Consequently, fractional denoising becomes equivalent to learning atomic forces under this approximate molecular distribution, providing a physically consistent force learning interpretation that improves sampling coverage and force target accuracy."

This mechanism dynamically weights historical embeddings across the entire past window, enabling the model to capture complex temporal dependencies and interactions. Coupled with positional and temporal embeddings to encode time semantics, the encoder constructs a rich, robust representation of the historical grid load data, effectively integrating multiple covariates and mitigating the transformer’s inherent order invariance. This robust representation serves as a comprehensive summary of prior grid load dynamics, which is critical for accurate sequence prediction in the decoder.\n\n---\n\n### Final concise answer:\n\nThe encoder's self-attention mechanism leverages past grid load embeddings by using bi-directional self-attention to attend across all past time steps simultaneously. This allows the model to capture complex temporal dependencies and interactions within the historical data, enhanced with positional and temporal embeddings to preserve time-order information. As a result, it constructs a robust, context-rich sequence representation of the past grid load, which supports accurate forecasting."

If schedules are uncertain or change unexpectedly, the model may produce inaccurate forecasts.\n\n2. **Lack of Native Handling of Uncertainty:** The architecture assumes planned future data as deterministic input, without explicit mechanisms to model probabilistic or uncertain schedules, making it fragile to deviations.\n\n3. **Risk of Forecast Degradation:** In the presence of uncertain or erroneous future inputs, the integration might deteriorate forecast performance, increasing outliers and errors.\n\n4. **Limited Robustness to Unforeseen Events:** Because the model relies on encoded expected futures, it may not adapt well to unplanned disruptions or events not captured in the planning data.\n\n5. **Challenge in Embedding Complex Schedule Variability:** The embedding strategies may inadequately capture the variability or uncertainty inherent in complex or dynamic scheduling environments.\n\n---\n\n### Final concise answer:\n\n**Potential limitations of the transformer architecture (mask1) when integrating expected future contextual information (mask2) under uncertain schedules include:**\n\n- The model’s reliance on precise and reliable future contextual inputs means that inaccuracies or uncertainties in schedules can lead to degraded forecast accuracy.  \n- The transformer decoder treats future information as deterministic and does not inherently model the uncertainty or variability in schedules.  \n- This can reduce robustness to deviations, leading to increased forecasting errors and outliers when actual events differ from planned schedules.  \n- Furthermore, embedding strategies may struggle to capture complex or uncertain schedule variations, limiting the model’s adaptability under uncertain conditions.\n\n---\n\n## **Answer:**\n\nThe primary limitations of the transformer model (mask1) when integrating expected future contextual information (mask2) under uncertain schedules stem from its strong dependence on accurate and reliable future inputs. Since the transformer decoder assumes the anticipated future data are precise and fixed, any uncertainty, variability, or errors in scheduling can degrade forecasting performance. The model lacks inherent mechanisms to explicitly handle schedule uncertainty, making it less robust to unforeseen deviations or changes. Consequently, deviations from planned schedules can lead to increased forecast errors and outliers, and the embedding techniques may not effectively capture the complexities of uncertain schedules, limiting adaptability in such scenarios."

This reduces the dependence on irregular or biased past grid load data and improves forecasting robustness by incorporating reliable planned information. Consequently, biases caused by irregular past patterns can be mitigated because forecasts are informed not only by historical trends but also by known future events represented via these tailored embeddings.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nAlternative embedding strategies for the expected future contextual information (as shown in the red-boxed b.2 in the diagram) mitigate biases from irregular past grid load patterns by distinctly embedding future covariates and integrating them through the transformer's decoder. This separation allows the model to leverage accurate planned and contextual information independent of past irregularities. By attending non-causally to these future embeddings, the model reduces over-reliance on biased historical trends, improving robustness and accuracy by effectively incorporating expected future events and operational plans directly into the forecasting process."

        "response": "The [MASK1] in the question refers to the content highlighted by the red box in the provided diagram, which is labeled as \"**Scribble expansion**.\"\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning to address the question:\n\n**Question**:  \nWhat ethical risks accompany automated [mask1] in annotating patient medical images?\n\n**Step 1: Identify what [mask1] is physically and conceptually:**  \nFrom the image (Figure 2) and the accompanying text in the context, the \"Scribble expansion\" refers to a process that expands limited scribble annotations (sparse, weak labels) to similar adjacent pixels within superpixels. This is done to generate denser supervision data from sparse annotations, leveraging image texture and boundaries.\n\n**Step 2: What is automated scribble expansion used for?**  \nIt is used to reduce annotation costs by enabling dense label information generation from a small number of sparse manual annotations (scribbles). The process is automated by leveraging superpixel segmentation and pixel similarity.\n\n**Step 3: What ethical risks might be associated with automated scribble expansion for annotating patient medical images?**\n\n- **Potential for Propagation of Errors and Noise:**  \n  The automated expansion process assigns labels to pixels based on adjacency and texture similarity. However, superpixels may not perfectly align with true anatomical boundaries, causing label noise or errors to be propagated beyond the originally scribbled region. This can lead to incorrect or misleading annotations.\n\n- **Risk of Inaccurate or Biased Annotations:**  \n  Since expansions are based on computational heuristics rather than detailed expert review, parts of the anatomy could be mislabeled or boundaries distorted. If these expanded annotations are used for training models, they might introduce bias or inaccuracies that affect model performance and diagnostic reliability.\n\n- **Reduced Transparency and Accountability:**  \n  Automated annotation methods may obscure the exact basis for labels in images. Without expert revision, errors introduced in scribble expansion may go unnoticed, reducing clinician trust and raising accountability issues if misdiagnosis or treatment errors occur.\n\n- **Data Privacy and Security Concerns:**  \n  Although not directly related to scribble expansion, any automated processing of patient medical images must consider privacy and data security. Automated processes may increase data handling steps, which must be secured.\n\n- **Over-reliance on Incomplete or Weak Labels:**  \n  Automated expansion is used because full annotation is costly. However, incomplete or weakly annotated data—even if expanded—may not fully capture complex clinical scenarios, leading to oversimplified or insufficient training data.\n\n**Step 4: What does the paper say about noise and reliability?**  \nThe paper explicitly mentions that superpixels may contain noise inconsistent with ground truth and that poor quality superpixels can introduce boundary noise. To mitigate this, dynamic thresholds and uncertainty measures are applied during training. However, it implicitly acknowledges that automated scribble expansion can introduce noise if improperly handled.\n\n### Final answer:\n\nAutomated **scribble expansion** in annotating patient medical images carries ethical risks including the propagation of annotation errors and noise beyond originally labeled regions, potentially leading to inaccurate or biased labels. This can result in misleading training data for models, which may adversely affect diagnostic performance and patient care. Additionally, automated methods may reduce transparency and accountability since clinicians might not fully oversee expanded annotations, raising trust and liability concerns. Over-reliance on incomplete or weakly labeled data automatically expanded without thorough expert validation risks oversimplification and omission of critical clinical details. Therefore, careful validation and handling of such automated annotation expansions are essential to mitigate these ethical risks."

This helps learn node features consistent with the supply chain graph structure.\n- However, GCN smoothing might overly smooth features, which could blur significant distinctions necessary to differentiate competitor nodes.\n- To counter this and better reconstruct node features, the authors employ **Laplacian sharpening** to reverse the smoothing effect of encoding. This sharpening helps restore finer details possibly lost during smoothing.\n\n### Step 2: Why integrate Laplacian Smoothing and Laplacian Sharpening?\n\n- The integration aims to balance **feature aggregation (smoothing)** and **feature refinement/restoration (sharpening)** during node embedding reconstruction.\n- Since the supply chain graph is directed and sparse competitor edges are missing, solely smoothing might lose critical discriminative features required for competitor detection.\n- By combining smoothing and sharpening, embeddings retain structural and attribute information while preserving essential distinguishing characteristics, thus improving reconstruction quality and the overall model's ability to detect competitors.\n\n### Step 3: Summarize the motivation\n\n**The motivation to integrate Laplacian Smoothing and Laplacian Sharpening in embedding reconstruction is to leverage the GCN’s natural smoothing ability to capture graph structure and node attributes, while simultaneously using sharpening to reverse excessive smoothing, thus preserving discriminative features necessary for accurately reconstructing node attributes and improving competitor detection.**\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:  \nThe integration of **Laplacian Smoothing** and **Laplacian Sharpening** in embedding reconstruction is motivated by the need to balance feature aggregation and refinement. Laplacian smoothing (via the GCN encoder) aggregates information from neighboring nodes to create smooth embeddings consistent with the supply chain graph structure. However, this can cause oversmoothing and loss of discriminative details. To counter this, Laplacian sharpening is applied in the decoder to reverse oversmoothing, restoring finer details that help reconstruct node features more accurately. This combination enhances the model’s capacity to extract meaningful structural and attribute information from the supply chain network, ultimately improving competitor detection."

This makes it highly effective for modeling temporal dynamics in video data by preserving the continuity and complexity of motion.\n\nIn contrast, the **sequential fusion in the Doppler Driven Block ([mask2])** models temporal information by applying sequential 2D convolutions combined with reshape operations that progressively fuse features extracted from individual frames. This approach captures temporal dependencies indirectly through feature fusion over time but does not perform convolution directly on the temporal dimension. While this method may be more computationally efficient or modular, it generally offers a less direct and potentially weaker representation of temporal dynamics compared to the 3D convolution stacking in the C3D block.\n\n# Final concise answer\nThe C3D block’s stacked convolution performs direct 3D convolutions across both spatial and temporal dimensions, providing strong, integrated spatiotemporal modeling by capturing continuous motion dynamics inherently. In contrast, the Doppler Driven block’s sequential fusion uses layers of 2D convolutions combined with reshaping to sequentially fuse temporal frame-wise features, modeling temporal information more indirectly and less holistically than the C3D’s explicit 3D convolutions."
